  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Card - Zelle - Get All". It's a GET API request
    which aims to retrieve all the card information related to the payment
    provider Zelle.


    Here's a detailed breakdown of each data:


    - `name`: The name of this endpoint is "Card - Zelle - Get All". It suggests
    that this endpoint is used to retrieve all Zelle card information.


    - `method`: This field specifies the request method used which is GET. GET
    is used when you want to retrieve data from a server.


    - `url`: The URL field provides the path to which the request will be sent.
    In this case, the URL is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/payment/card/getAll/cardId". This suggests that
    the API will be hitting a local server on port 3000 to execute the request.
    The call is to the 'payment' service, specifically to get all the cards of
    type 'Zelle'. It also indicates that 'cardId' is passed in the URL as a path
    parameter.

        - The URL contains a few query parameters:
            - `provider`: It specifies the payment provider which is set as 'zelle'.
            - `accountId`: This query parameter is used to pass the specific account ID for which payment card data is fetched.
            - `sessionId`: This query parameter is to pass the session ID. Most likely, it is used for session management and tracking the user session.

    - `headers`: As of now, there are no custom headers specified in the
    request. Headers often contain metadata and additional information such as
    content type, authorization information etc. that the server should know
    about.
