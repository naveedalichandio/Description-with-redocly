  description: >-
    This endpoint is called "Article - Category - Get By Short ID". It is used
    to retrieve a specific article category by a shorter identifier known as
    "shortId". Now let's dive into each aspect of this endpoint:


    1. "name": This property indicates the name of the endpoint, which is
    "Article - Category - Get By Short ID".


    2. "request": This property contains the majority of the data for running
    this API call. 


    3. "auth": This property describes the authentication method used for this
    API request. This endpoint uses the 'bearer' token type. The "bearer" array
    includes:
        - "key": This signifies the type of data being sent in the bearer token. In this case, it is "token".
        - "value": The "BearerToken" specifies the expected value. It should be replaced with a valid token string while using this endpoint.
        - "type": This characterizes the data type of the token. As mentioned here, it's a string.

    4. "method": This property mentions the HTTP method to be used, which in
    this case is "GET".


    5. "url": This is the API's endpoint URL where the Get request is being
    sent.
    "http://localhost:3000/api/article/category/get/?shortId=articleCategoryShortId"
    is the URL, and 'articleCategoryShortId' at the end is a placeholder for the
    short identifier that should be used to fetch the specific article category.


    6. "headers": This array usually contains any additional HTTP headers to be
    sent with the API request. However, in this case, the "key" and "value"
    fields are empty, and the header is set to disabled. It would appear that
    there are no additional headers required for this endpoint.


    7. "body": This part of the request contains the data that is going out with
    the request. In this case, the mode is set to 'raw', and the 'raw' field is
    empty since there's no data to be sent with the GET request. 


    In summary, this endpoint is intended to fetch a specific article category
    by its 'shortId' using a GET request. It requires a bearer token for
    authentication.
