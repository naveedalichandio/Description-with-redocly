  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Account - Verify - Email Address". It is designed to
    verify an email address linked to an account. 


    It uses the `POST` method, which allows it to send data to the server to
    create a new entry in the database. The `POST` method is often used when
    submitting filled forms.


    The URL for this endpoint is
    `"http://localhost:3000/api/account/verify/email"`. This endpoint lies
    within your local server running on port 3000. Its path is
    `/api/account/verify/email`, whereby it's within the 'api', 'account',
    'verify', then finally, 'email' subdirectory.


    Currently, it does not contain any custom `headers`. Headers are often used
    to provide information about the request body and the response, such as its
    MIME type, or to provide authentication information. If necessary, headers
    could be added accordingly.


    The `body` of the request is being sent in `raw` mode. Raw mode is used when
    you want to send information without any encoding. This is useful when you
    want to send JSON or XML data to the server.


    The raw data being sent consists of two key-value pairs:


    - `verificationToken`: The token used to verify the email. This would
    typically be a unique string that the server generates and sends to the
    email address for verification.

    - `email`: The email address to be verified. This must match the email
    address that the server has on record for the associated verification token.


    In normal usage, both `verificationToken` and `email` would need to be
    replaced with actual data.
