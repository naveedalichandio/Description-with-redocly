    **Endpoint Description: Web - Socket - Recent Channel**

    - **Name**: Web - Socket - Recent Channel
      - This is the identifier for the API endpoint, indicating that it deals with recent channels within a web socket context.

    - **Request**: 
      - This section outlines the details of the API call that can be made to retrieve data.

      - **Method**: 
        - **GET**
          - This specifies that the request will be a 'GET' method, which is typically used to fetch data from a server.

      - **URL**: 
        - `http://localhost:3000/api/socket/web/channel?recent=true&limit=limit`
          - This is the endpoint URL where the GET request will target.
          - It consists of the following components:
            - `http://localhost:3000`: This indicates that the API is being accessed locally on port 3000.
            - `/api/socket/web/channel`: This portion specifies that the request is related to the web socket API for channels.
