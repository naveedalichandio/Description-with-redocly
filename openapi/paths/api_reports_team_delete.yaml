    This endpoint is named "Reports - Team - Delete". As the name suggests, it
    is used to delete reports associated with a particular team. 


    The authentication type for this endpoint requires a "Bearer Token".  It
    uses the bearer authentication scheme whereby the bearer of the token sends
    it in the Authorization header.


    An example of the token usage:

    "type": "Bearer token sessionid"

    Here, "sessionid" is representing the value that needs to be provided for
    the "Bearer Token".


    The HTTP method for this endpoint is "POST", meaning it's designed to send
    data to the server for a specific resource.


    The URL indicates the location where this request is sent. In this case, we
    are performing an action on "http://localhost:3000/api/reports/team/delete".
    This is the address to which the 'POST' request is made.


    The headers field is empty in this example and has been disabled as well.
    Headers hold additional information (key-value pairs) to be sent with the
    request, but it's not being used in this case.


    The request body is sent in 'raw' format and contains the data to be sent to
    the server. This raw information is a JSON object containing three
    parameters:


    1. "sessionId": This is likely an identifier used by the server to validate
    your session. In a fully-fledged application, this would be dynamically
    replaced with an active session ID.

    2. "accountId": This is likely the identifier for your account, used to
    determine which account to perform the action on.

    3. "teamId": This is probably the identifier for a specific team. It's what
    helps the server know which team's reports you're intending to delete.


    To successfully make a request to this endpoint, these input parameters must
    be replaced with real values according to your system's specifications.
