    Auth: This pertains to the authentication method required for the endpoint.
    In this case, a bearer token is needed for authentication. The 'key'
    specifies the type of token, which is a 'BearerToken'. The 'type' tells you
    that the token should be a string.


    Method: This field shows the HTTP method used by the endpoint. Here it is
    'GET'. This method is usually used to retrieve data from the server.


    URL: This field specifies the URL where the request is sent. In this case,
    it is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/events/subcategory/all/?categoryId=eventCategoryId".
    This URL gets all sub categories by Category ID.

    request. In this case a default header is included but it is disabled and
    both the 'key' and 'value' fields are empty. 


    Body: This field contains the data that is sent to the server in a 'raw'
    format. However, for this endpoint the 'raw' body is empty as the data
