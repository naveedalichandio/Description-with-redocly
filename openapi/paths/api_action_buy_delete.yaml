    ### Action - Buy - Delete Endpoint Description


    This endpoint is designed to delete a specific buy action associated with a
    user account.


    1. **Request Method**: 
       - **POST**: This method is used to send data to the server to perform the delete action.

    2. **URL**: 
       - **http://localhost:3000/api/action/buy/delete**: This is the local server URL where the delete request is sent. The path indicates that it’s related to actions for buying.

    3. **Authentication**: 
       - **Type**: Bearer Token.
       - **Token**: The user must provide a session token identified by the key “token”. This token is essential for verifying the user’s identity and permission to perform the delete action.

    4. **Headers**: 
       - Currently, there are no additional headers included in the request, which means default behavior will apply. The header field is marked as disabled.

    5. **Body**: 
       - **Mode**: Raw.
       - **Content**: The body of the request is sent in JSON format and contains three fields:
         - **sessionId**: Represents the user's session ID to authenticate the request. This should match the token provided in the authentication step.
         - **accountId**: This field specifies the account related to the buy action that needs to be deleted. It identifies whose action is being targeted.
         - **buyId**: This uniquely identifies the specific buy action that is to be deleted from the system.

    Ensure you replace the placeholders such as "sessionId", "accountId", and
    "buyId" with actual values when making a request to this endpoint.
