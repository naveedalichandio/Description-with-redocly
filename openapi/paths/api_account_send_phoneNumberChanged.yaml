  summary: Account - Send - Phone Number Changed Notification
  description: >-
    This endpoint accepts a POST request to the path
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/send/phoneNumberChanged". It's used to
    notify the system that the phone number associated with the provided account
    has been changed.


    Let's break the request into parts:


    1. `"name"`: The name field provides a descriptive label for the endpoint.
    In this case, the name suggests an action, which in terminalogy, "sends a
    notification for a changed phone number on an account".


    2. `"auth"`: This is the type of authorization needed to access the endpoint
    with bearer as the authentication method. This means a bearer token needs to
    be attached in the header of the request for successful authorization. 
       - `"key"`: Describes the key used within the bearer authorization, which here is "token".
       - `"value"`: The value associated with the key. For this request, the value should be the actual bearer token, "BearerToken" is just a placeholder.

    3. `"method"`: The HTTP verb associated with the request. In this case, it's
    a "POST" method, which is typically used to send data to a server to create
    a new resource.


    4. `"url"`: The URL field contains the endpoint's path. This is required for
    determining where the request will be sent.


    5. `"headers"`: These are additional pieces of information required by the
    server.
       - `"key"`: The header's key which is "Client-UUID".
       - `"value"`: The value associated with the key in the header, represented here by "ClientUUID".

    6. `"body"`: Contains the data that is sent to the server. In "raw" mode,
    the data must be a string, often in JSON format.
       - `"sessionId"`: Identifies the current user's session. This ID is unique to a user's session.
       - `"accountId"`: The unique identifier for the user's account.
       - `"email"`: The email associated with the user's account.
