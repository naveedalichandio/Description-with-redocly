  summary: Chat - Thread - Create Video
  description: >-
    This endpoint is labeled "Chat - Thread - Create Video." It's used to create
    a new chat thread for video comments using a POST request.


    1. `auth`: This indicates the type of authentication used for this endpoint.
    The auth type is "bearer", which usually involves a bearer token provided in
    the headers of the HTTP request for user identification. Its key is "token,"
    which holds the value "BearerToken."


    2. `method`: It states the HTTP request method that we're using. In this
    case, "POST," which is generally used for sending data to the API server to
    create a new resource.


    3. `url`: This is the URL to where the API request is sent. This particular
    endpoint is "http://localhost:3000/api/chat/thread/create".


    4. `headers`: Headers allow the client and server to share additional
    information with the HTTP request or response. The request doesn't include
    any specific headers in this case. 


    5. `body`: This contains the data we're sending with our POST request. In
    this case, it's in the "raw" mode, meaning the data is sent as a string in
    JSON format. 

       Included in the request body are: 
        - `ownerId`: A string that refers to the account ID of the owner of this chat thread. 
        - `accountId`: A string that specifies the account ID attempting to create this chat thread.
        - `sessionId`: This could be a unique identifier for the specific session during which this chat thread is created.
        - `threadName`: A string that provides the name for this chat thread. For this endpoint, it seems to be specified as "Video Comments."
        - `threadType`: This indicates the type of thread being created. In this case, it's a "video".
        - `threadTypeId`: A string that refers to the ID of the video associated with this thread.

    6. `options`: This contains extra payload options for the "raw" request
    body. They're set to indicate the language of the request body is JSON. Note
    this doesn't affect the API request itself, but can make it easier for
    people to understand the data if they're reading it.
