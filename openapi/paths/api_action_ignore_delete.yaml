      - **Type**: Bearer
        - This indicates that the request requires a bearer token for authentication.

    - **Headers**: 
      - The headers section is currently empty with a disabled entry. You can add any necessary HTTP headers (like Content-Type) here if needed, but as it stands, there are no headers in use.

    #### Request Body


    - **Mode**: 
      - **Raw**: The body format being used is raw data. This means the data is sent as plain text.

    - **Raw Data**: 
      - The body of the request contains JSON formatted data that includes:
        - **sessionId**: A placeholder string `sessionId`. This should contain the actual session identifier for the user.
        - **accountId**: A placeholder string `accountId`. This should represent the unique identifier for the userâ€™s account that is being referenced in the operation.
