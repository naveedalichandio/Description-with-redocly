  summary: Media - Audio - Delete
  description: >-
    This endpoint is titled "Media - Audio - Delete". It features a request
    method of "POST", which implies this endpoint is used for deleting a
    specified audio media from the web server.


    The authentication required for this endpoint is of type "bearer". This
    entails providing a token in the bearer field with the key "token" that's
    linked with your "sessionId". This is a string type field and represents the
    session ID of the user making the request.


    The URL, "http://localhost:3000/api/media/audio/delete", is where the
    request is sent. This path signifies that the endpoint is intended for
    deleting audio media.


    In the headers section, a default type header is mentioned. Its key-value
    pairs are undefined and this header is disabled indicating it may not be
    necessary for the request.


    The main data that is required while making the request is embedded in the
    raw body of the request payload. It takes the "raw" form and needs to be
    sent as a JSON string.


    The raw body needs to include three properties: "sessionId", "accountId",
    "audioId". The "sessionId" is a repeat of the session ID that is assigned
    during logging in. This identifies the client's session.


    The "accountId" property is also a string and represents the user's account
    ID. It is necessary to ensure that the operation is performed for the
    correct user's account. 


    Last but not least, the "audioId" is another string property in the raw
    payload. This should correlate to the specific ID of the audio media file
    that you want to be deleted. The system uses this to know the exact audio
    file to remove in the database or storage.


    Remember to appropriately replace the "sessionId", "accountId", and
    "audioId" placeholders with actual values when you intend to execute the
    request.
