    This endpoint is named "Account - Send - Password Reset Code to SMS". It
    adopts the POST method, indicating that it is designed to push (insert) data
    to the server. The request URL of this endpoint is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/send/passwordResetSMS". This suggests
    that it is locally hosted and used for sending password reset codes to a
    specified SMS.


    It requires bearer authentication. It means you need to supply a bearer
    token which is used to authorize and authenticate the request.

    The placeholder value here is "BearerToken."


    Under Headers, we find additional authorization parameters.

    individual clients invoking this API endpoint. Put your Client UUID in the
    place of 'ClientUUID' here.


    Coming to the body of the endpoint, it contains a raw JSON object with the
    following data,


    "sessionId": It refers to the unique session identifier. Replace 'sessionId'
    with the actual session Id.


    "accountId": It refers to a specific user's account identifier. 'accountId'
    here needs to be replaced with the actual account Id.


    "securityCode": A placeholder (123456) for the security code used in the
    password reset process. It should be replaced with a real security code.


    "phone": A placeholder (18327051031) for the phone number to which the
    password reset SMS will be sent. It should be replaced with the target phone
    number.
