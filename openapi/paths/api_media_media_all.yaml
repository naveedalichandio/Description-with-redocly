    **Endpoint Description:**


    **Name: "Media - Video - Get All"**

    This is the label or identifier of the endpoint. It suggests that this
    endpoint's primary task is to retrieve (Get) all video media.


    **Request:**

    It covers various aspects regarding the API request that will be made.


    **Auth-->Type: "bearer"**

    This refers to the authentication method that is employed for this request.
    Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP
    authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.
    The name "Bearer authentication" can be understood as "give access to the
    bearer of this token".


    **Auth-->Bearer-->Key: "token"**

    This is the key information required for bearer authorization. It's
    typically named 'token'.


    **Auth-->Bearer-->Value: "BearerToken"**

    This is the actual bearer token for authentication. Replace "BearerToken"
    with the real bearer token.


    **Auth-->Bearer-->Type: "string"**

    This indicates the data type of the bearer token. In this case, it is a
    string.


    **Method: "GET"**

    This defines the HTTP method to be used when making the API request. A 'GET'
    request is used to request data from a resource.


    **URL:
    "http://localhost:3000/api/media/media/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId"**

    This is the API's endpoint URL. The parameters 'sessionId' and 'accountId'
    should be replaced with actual session and account id values.


    **Headers:**

    These are additional parameters that can be sent with the request. At
    present, there isn't any specific key-value pair given.


    **Body-->Mode: "raw"**

    This indicates the data mode for the body of the request. The 'raw' mode
    allows you to write text, JSON, XML or HTML requests directly in the text
    editor.


    **Body-->Raw: ""**

    Since it's a GET request, no body data needs to be sent, which is why this
    field is empty.


    Remember to replace all placeholder values with actual data before making
    the request.
