  summary: Notification - Videos - Delete
  description: >-
    "Notification - Videos - Delete" is the name of the API endpoint. This name
    is significant because it labels what the API endpoint is and what it's for.
    It indicates the primary functionality of deleting notifications related to
    videos.


    The `request` field defines the details of the request that will be made to
    the endpoint. 


    The `auth` field within the request is used for authentication. In this
    case, it makes use of a "bearer" type token. This token is passed in the
    headers with the key name 'token' and its value set to 'sessionId'. The
    'sessionId' is unique for each session and as such it is essential for
    authentication.


    The `method` field indicates the HTTP method that will be used for the
    request. As it is 'POST', it suggests that the endpoint will process the
    provided data or changes the state based on the data.


    The `url` field: This points to the location of the endpoint which is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/videos/delete". 


    In the `headers` field, there are options for adding additional headers. In
    this case, the API does not require any extra headers as the value of the
    key field and the key itself are both empty and it is disabled.


    The 'body' field contains the actual data that we want to send or process.
    Inside the body field, we have the 'mode' set to 'raw'. This indicates that
    the body data will be sent as a raw JSON string. In the 'raw' field, there's
    a JSON string with the keys 'sessionId', 'accountId', 'videosId'. These
    likely represent the session ID of the user, the account ID of the user, and
    the IDs of the videos that need to be deleted from the notifications
    respectively.
