  summary: Account - Send - New Followers Notification Email
  description: >-
    This endpoint, named "Account - Send - New Followers Notification Email", is
    designed to automatically send an email notification when a user has new
    followers on their account. It utilizes the `POST` method and interacts with
    a specific `API` at "http://localhost:3000/api/account/send/newFollowers".


    Starting with `auth` block, it employs `bearer token` authentication which
    denotes that to achieve successful communication with this API, you'll need
    to include the relevant access token string under the `bearer` field in the
    `auth` section. The placeholder for this token is represented as
    "BearerToken".


    The `request` section also defines a `client-UUID` header where a
    universally unique client identifier must be substituted in place of
    "ClientUUID". This identifier is used to uniquely identify each client that
    uses this endpoint.


    And finally, the `body` section of the request takes three key parts which
    are `sessionId`, `accountId`, and `newFollowers` in JSON format. The
    `sessionId` and `accountId` refer to the unique identifiers for a user's
    session and account respectively where you would replace "sessionId" and
    "accountId" with actual values. For the `newFollowers`, it takes an array of
    strings replacing "John Smith","Andy Lee","Michael Jordan" with the actual
    names of new followers.


    Remember that all the data provided in `request` section should adhere to
    the right string format as stipulated for each item. Keep your `token`,
    `ClientUUID`, `sessionId` and `accountId` confidential in order to uphold
    the security of your data.
