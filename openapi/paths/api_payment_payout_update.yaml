    This endpoint is titled "Payout - Zelle - Update." It performs a PUT
    request, a type of HTTP method that is generally used to update existing
    resources. The URL for this endpoint is
    http://localhost:3000/api/payment/payout/update, which seems to suggest that
    it is used to update existing payout information for a payment.


    The body of the request contains several fields:


    1. "accountId" - This field likely holds a unique identifier for the account
    that the payout is being updated for.


    2. "sessionId" - This is also some unique identifier and it probably refers
    to the specific session in which the update is being made.


    3. "payoutId" - This field presumably houses a unique identifier
    specifically for the payout that is being updated.


    4. "source" - The endpoint accepts null for this field, suggesting that it
    is optional. Its use is not specified here.


    5. "isSavePayout" - This is a boolean field that suggests whether the
    updated payout details should be saved or not. 


    6. "isPrimary" - Another boolean field, possibly indicating whether this
    payout is set as the default or main payout method for the account.


    7. "provider" - This field appears to specify who the payout provider is. In
    this case, it's given as Zelle, an online payments company.


    These fields are sent as raw, which means that they are not encoded in any
    way before being sent. They are also all written in JSON language. The
    request does not seem to include any specific headers. Overall, this
    endpoint appears to be for updating payout information for a payment in the
    identified account and session.
