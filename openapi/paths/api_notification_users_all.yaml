    - `name`: This attribute refers to the name of the specific endpoint. In
    this case, "Notification - Users - Get All". This name serves as a brief
    description of the endpoint's functionality, i.e., retrieving all
    notifications for users.


    - `request`: This object encapsulates all the details related to the HTTP
    request to be made to a specific service. 

      - `auth`: This object describes the authentication method to be used for the request. The `type` specifies the authentication type. Here, a bearer token is used.
      
        - `bearer`: This array includes the details of the bearer token authentication. Each item in the array is an object that contains a `key` (i.e., the name of the field), `value` (i.e., the actual bearer token), and the `type` of the value, which in this instance is a string.
      

      - `method`: This defines the HTTP method to be used for the request. Here, it is GET method.
      
      - `url`: This is the API endpoint to which the request will be sent. The current URL includes query parameters (`sessionId` and `accountId`) which will need to be populated with appropriate values to retrieve notifications for a specific account and session.
      
      - `headers`: This array represents any additional HTTP headers that should be included in the request. It is currently empty and thus disabled, indicating that no extra headers are to be sent.
      
      - `body`: This contains any data that has to be sent in the body of the HTTP request. It contains `mode` and `raw`. The `mode` describes the way data present in the body should be formatted prior to being sent with the request. For instances, `raw` data is sent as it is without any modifications. But in this case, the `raw` value is an empty string indicating that no data is sent with the HTTP request.
