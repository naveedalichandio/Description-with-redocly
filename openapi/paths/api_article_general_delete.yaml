  description: >-
    This endpoint is called "Article - General - Delete". As the name suggests,
    it is used to delete a general article. This is what each part of the
    endpoint does:


    1. `auth`: This section deals with authentication. This endpoint uses
    `bearer` authentication. Here, `token` is the key, `sessionId` is the value
    and the type of the `bearer token` is a `string`. This means you need to
    input a valid session ID as your bearer token to be able to successfully
    access this endpoint.


    2. `method`: The method used here is `POST`. This means you're sending data
    to the server with the request to delete a specific general article.


    3. `url`: This is the URL you must send your request to. In this case, it is
    http://localhost:3000/api/article/general/delete.


    4. `headers`: The headers are set to `default` and `disabled`, which means
    no extra HTTP headers are included in the request.


    5. `body`: This section specifies the data you send to the server. The
    `mode` specified here is `raw`, which means you're sending a string of text.
       
       Inside the `raw` string, there are three properties:
       - `sessionId`: This is where you input the ID of the session.
       - `accountId`: This is where you input the ID of the account that wants to delete the article.
       - `article`: This is where you input the article that you want to delete.

    Make sure to replace `sessionId`, `accountId` and `article` with the actual
    information during your request.
