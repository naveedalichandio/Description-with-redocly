  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Account - Send - User New Comment Request Email". It
    is designed to send an email notification to a user when a new comment is
    made on their account.


    Here is a breakdown of the data:


    - `auth`: This specifies the authorization method that is being used. In
    this case, the type is "bearer". The bearer key-value pair should be
    supplied, having a value of type string. 


    - `method`: This specifies the HTTP method that should be used for the
    request. In this case, the POST method is used, indicating that data will be
    sent to the server.


    - `url`: This is the URL that the request will be sent to. The path
    `http://localhost:3000/api/account/send/userNewComment` is the designated
    route for sending user new comment request emails.


    - `headers`: This is an array of objects that represents the headers that
    should be included in the HTTP request. The Client-UUID key, which carries a
    value of type default is required, you need to substitute "ClientUUID" with
    the appropriate value.


    - `body`: This describes the data that is being sent in the request. The
    body content is in raw format. The raw string contains a JSON object with
    four properties:
      
      - `sessionId`: A string that uniquely identifies the current session.

      - `accountId`: A string that uniquely identifies the account that the comment is being made on. 

      - `commenterId`: A unique identifier for the user who has made the comment. The example provided is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual value.

      - `comment`: A string representing the content of the user's comment. The example "HELLO WORLD!" is a placeholder for actual comment.

    Do replace the placeholder values with actual values before making the
    request.
