    customizable settings. Below is a detailed description of each data field in
    the request body.


    #### Request Body Fields:


    - **sessionId**: Represents the unique identifier for the current user
    session. This is used to track the user's activity and ensure that actions

    - **accountId**: This is the unique identifier for the user's account. It
    links the channel to the specific account of the user creating it.

    identified and searched. For example, "Fortune".

    into the content or the purpose of the channel. For example, "This channel
    is by Fortune Vieyra".


    - **tags**: A comma-separated list of keywords associated with the channel.
    Tags help categorize the channel and make it easier for users to find
    content, such as "second,channel".


    - **profilePhotoUrl**: The URL link to the profile photo of the channel.
    This image represents the channel visually across the platform. For example,
    "https://example.com/profile.jpg".


    - **coverPhotoUrl**: The URL link to the cover photo of the channel. This is
    the larger image that appears at the top of the channel page, providing a
    visual identity. For example, "https://example.com/cover.jpg".


    - **minimumTipAmount**: The minimum amount that a viewer can tip the channel
    creator. This is defined in the currency set by the platform. For example,
    the minimum tip could be 10 units.


    - **unlockAmount**: The amount required to unlock specific content or
    features in the channel. For example, an unlock amount of 1 unit might be
    charged to access exclusive videos.


    - **category**: The main category that the channel falls under. This helps
    users navigate channels by content type. An example would be "General".


    - **subCategory**: A more specific classification within the main category.
    This helps further refine the channelâ€™s classification, such as "Specific".


    - **searchType**: Specifies the type of content that can be searched within
    the channel. For example, "Game" indicates that the channel may focus on
    gaming-related content.


    - **isEnabled**: A boolean value indicating whether the channel is currently
    active and visible to users. If set to true, the channel is enabled.


    - **isChannelPrivate**: A boolean value that specifies whether the channel
    is private and only accessible to selected viewers. If true, only invited
    users can view the channel.


    - **isTournamentOnly**: A boolean that indicates if the channel is
    exclusively for tournaments. If set to true, only tournament-related content
    will be available.


    - **isChannelDefault**: A boolean value indicating whether this channel
    should be set as the default channel. If true, it may be the first option
    users see when accessing video channels.


    - **isPreLiveVideoAds**: A boolean indicating whether ads are shown before
    the live video starts. If true, viewers will see ads prior to the content.


    - **isPostLiveVideoAds**: A boolean indicating whether ads are shown after
    the live video ends. If true, viewers will see ads after the content
    concludes.


    - **breakPreLiveVideoUrl**: URL to a video that will be played during breaks
    before the live video starts. This content can keep viewers engaged until
    the live stream begins.


    - **breakLivePauseVideoUrl**: URL to a video that will play if the live
    stream is paused. This ensures viewers have something to watch rather than a
    blank screen.


    - **breakPostLiveVideoUrl**: URL to a video that will play after the live
    stream ends. This could contain highlights or additional content related to
    the channel.
