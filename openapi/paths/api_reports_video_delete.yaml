    This endpoint is named "Reports - Video - Delete". It is used to delete
    videos from the report. 


    The request uses the "POST" method, indicating it is designed to send
    information to the server to create a new resource. 


    You need to authenticate yourself in order to access this endpoint. The
    authorization uses the "bearer" type, which means that the authentication
    information is sent in the header of the request. The bearer token, which is
    a unique key generated for each user, is required for this endpoint. The
    token is represented by a session ID, which is a string type.


    The URL of the endpoint is `http://localhost:3000/api/reports/video/delete`.
    This is the location where the request should be sent. The 'localhost' and
    the port '3000' indicate that the server is running locally in the
    development environment.


    There is a header field available in this endpoint but it is disabled and
    contains no key or value.


    The request body contains data that is sent to the server. It uses the "raw"
    mode, which allows you to write directly in the text input. The raw body
    data includes three parameters which are represented as a JSON object. 


    The "sessionId" is a string that represents the session ID of the user. It
    is a unique identifier that points to the session of the authenticated
    user. 


    The "accountId" indicates the account ID which may be used to specify the
    account from which the video should be deleted.


    The "videoId" is used to specify the particular video in the report you want
    to delete. It is a unique identifier for each video in the database. 


    Make sure to replace "sessionId", "accountId", and "videoId" with real
    values before sending the request.
