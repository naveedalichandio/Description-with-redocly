      - **method:** This specifies the HTTP method used for the request. In this case, it is a POST request, indicating data is being sent to the server.

      - **url:** This is the endpoint where the request will be sent. It consists of the base URL (`http://localhost:3000`) and the path (`/api/socket/web/disconnect`) specifically designed for handling WebSocket disconnection requests.

      - **headers:** This is an array that can include any HTTP headers you may want to send with the request. Currently, it is empty, suggesting no additional headers are required for this request.

      - **body:** This section contains the data being sent in the request body.
      
        - **mode:** This indicates the format of the body data. Here, it is set to "raw", meaning the data is being sent as raw text rather than form data or another format.

        - **raw:** This is the actual content that is sent in the body of the request. It is in JSON format and includes two fields:
          - **socketId:** This is a placeholder for the identifier of the WebSocket connection that needs to be disconnected.
