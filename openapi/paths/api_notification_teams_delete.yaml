  summary: Notification - Teams - Delete
  description: >-
    Here is a detailed description of each data in the endpoint for your Postman
    API collection:


    1. "name": This field contains the name of the endpoint. In this case, the
    name is "Notification - Teams - Delete", which suggests that this endpoint
    is used to delete notifications related to teams.


    2. "request": This field contains all the required information to make a
    request to the server. It includes authentication information, the HTTP
    method, the request URL, any necessary headers, and the request body.


    3. "auth": This subfield within the "request" data is responsible for the
    authentication methods needed to make a request. It's a Bearer type, meaning
    you have to provide a specific token to authenticate.


    4. "type": This indicates the type of Authentication used. Here the value is
    "bearer", meaning that the client must send a bearer token for
    authorization.


    5. "bearer": Contains an array of one object, which has three properties
    (key, value, and type). The "key" is set as "token", the "value" is set as
    "sessionId", and the "type" is set as "string".


    6. "method": This determines the kind of request made to the server. Here
    it's set as "POST", indicating that data is being sent to the server to
    create/update a resource.


    7. "url": This shows the URL where the request is sent. In this case, the
    request is being sent to
    "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/teams/delete", which is likely an
    endpoint that supports deletion of team notifications.


    8. "headers": This array is used to send additional information with the
    HTTP request. Here, the object within the array doesn't have any values
    provided which means no extra headers are sent in the request.


    9. "body": This contains the actual data that you want to send with your
    POST request. Here, it is being sent as raw JSON data that contains
    "sessionId", "accountId" and "teamsId".


    10. "mode": Describes how the data in the body is being sent. Here, it's
    "raw", which means you're sending the data as a string in the exact format
    you specified.


    11. "raw": This is the actual raw data being sent in the HTTP body. It
    appears to be a JSON string that includes "sessionId", "accountId", and
    "teamsId". Each of these properties is very likely used to identify the
    session, the account and the special team that the notification belongs to.
