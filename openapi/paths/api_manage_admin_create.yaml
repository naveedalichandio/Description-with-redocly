    This is the description of each data on the `Manage - Admin - Create`
    endpoint:


    1. `name`: This denotes the name of the endpoint, which is 'Manage - Admin -
    Create'.


    2. `request`: This object contains the actual details of the HTTP request.


    3. Within `request`:
        - `auth`: Specifies the authentication method and details. The `type` is 'Bearer' indicating Bearer token authentication.
       
           - `bearer`: Array containing details of the bearer token. 
              - `key`: This is the key which is supposed to be 'token' in this case.
              - `value`: The value of the key is 'BearerToken'. It should be your actual bearer token.
              - `type`: The type of the value, which is 'string' in this case.
       
        - `method`: The HTTP method to be used. Here, 'POST' method is used meaning that it is used to send data to a server to create a resource.
       
        - `url`: The endpoint of the API where the request will be sent. In this case, it is 'http://localhost:3000/api/manage/admin/create'.
       
        - `headers`: An array that is meant to contain any headers to be sent with the request. In this case, no additional headers are sent thus its `disabled` status is `true`.

        - `body`: The details of the request body.
           
           - `mode`: The mode of the body data. Here, it is 'raw', meaning it is presented as is, and not as form data or file.
           - `raw`: Represents the JSON data to be sent with the API request. It contains several key-value pairs including session ID, account ID, name, description, tags, profile photo URL, cover photo URL, minimum tip amount, category ID, category, subcategory ID, subcategory, privacy feature, tournament option, default settings,  ad management settings, URLs for pre- and post-live ad breaks.
           - `options`: Details about the 'raw' data.
               
               - `language`: The language in which the data is written. In this case it is 'json'.

    Please replace placeholders with actual values (like 'sessionId',
    'accountId', 'BearerToken') to make this endpoint work correctly.
