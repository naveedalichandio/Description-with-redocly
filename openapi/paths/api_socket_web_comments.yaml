    ### Web - Socket - Recent Comments


    This endpoint retrieves the most recent comments by using a WebSocket
    connection. It is specifically designed to allow for real-time updates on
    comments as they are posted.


    #### Request Breakdown


    - **Method**: 
      - `GET`: This indicates that the request is made to retrieve data from the server.

    - **URL**: 
      - `http://localhost:3000/api/socket/web/comments?recent=true&limit=limit`: This is the endpoint where the request is sent. 
        - The base URL is `http://localhost:3000/api/socket/web/comments`, and it is appended with two query parameters:
          - `recent=true`: This parameter requests only the most recent comments.
          - `limit=limit`: This parameter specifies the maximum number of comments to return. Replace `limit` with an actual number to set the desired limit.

    - **Headers**: 
      - `[]`: This indicates that no additional headers are sent with this request. Headers may sometimes be necessary for authentication or other purposes, but in this case, none are included.

    This endpoint is useful for applications that require fetching the latest
    comments dynamically, enhancing user engagement with real-time data.
