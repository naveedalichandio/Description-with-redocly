  summary: Media - Audio - Get - For Public
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Media - Audio - Get - For Public". It is a GET
    request used to fetch audio data for the public based on the provided audio
    ID.


    1. **Authentication:** The endpoint uses Bearer authentication. A token
    ("BearerToken") should be provided in order to authenticate the request. The
    token should be a string type. 


    2. **Method:** GET: This method is used when you are trying to get data from
    a specified resource. 


    3. **URL:** The URL where the request is sent is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/media/audio/get/". Two URL parameters are
    required, 'audioId' and 'public'. 
       - 'audioId' represents the unique identifier for each audio and should be replaced with the actual audio id.
       - 'public' is a flag to denote whether the audio is available for the public. If it's set to 1, it means the audio is available for the public.

    4. **Headers:** Although a key-value pair for headers is provided, it is
    currently empty and is disabled, which means it will not be sent along with
    your request.


    5. **Body:** The body of the request is set to be in raw mode. However, as
    this is a GET request, no actual body data is sent in the request. The
    provided 'raw' field is empty and will be ignored.
