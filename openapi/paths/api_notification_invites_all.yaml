  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Notification - Invites - Get All". It is a GET
    request and its primary purpose is to retrieve all invites' notifications. 


    The request made to this endpoint requires bearer authentication. The Bearer
    Token should be inserted in the 'token' field to ensure authorized access to
    this endpoint. This token is a string value and will act as an authorization
    key.


    The base URL for this endpoint is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/invites/all/". It accepts two
    parameters which are included in the URL: 'sessionId' and 'accountId'. 

    - 'sessionId' is expected to be filled with the reference to the specific
    session related to the notifications. 

    - 'accountId' is to be filled with the account's unique identifier related
    to the notifications to be fetched. 


    In headers, a default key-value pair is given, but it is disabled by default
    and is not contributing any additional information to the request.


    The body of the request uses the 'raw' mode, but it doesn't contain any data
    (signified by the 'raw' field being empty). This means no additional data is
    sent within the request body for this endpoint. 


    Please ensure to replace 'BearerToken', 'sessionId', and 'accountId' with
    your actual bearer token, session id, and account id respectively while
    making a request.
