    This endpoint is named "Product - Zelle - Delete". It is set up for a `POST`
    request, which typically implies data submission or an action involving
    manipulation or deletion of data.


    The URL for this request is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/payment/product/delete`. It suggests that this
    endpoint could be used to delete a product from a payment collection stored
    locally (localhost:3000) via the API route `/api/payment/product/delete`.


    There are no specific headers set for this request, which might suggest
    there's are no restrictions related to language, origin, authorization etc,
    unless, they're already handled in some different way.


    The request body is configured in `raw` mode. It consists of a JSON object
    that is expected to contain four properties:


    1. `accountId` : This is likely to be a unique identifier for a user account
    within your system. You should replace "accountId" with the actual ID of the
    account.


    2. `sessionId`: It seems like an identifier for the current session. It
    could be used for verifying that the user session is valid. Replace
    "sessionId" with the actual session ID.


    3. `productId`: This appears to be a unique identifier for the product that
    is intended to be deleted. Replace "productId" with the actual product ID.


    4. `provider`: This is set as "zelle". It indicates that the payment
    provider for the product is Zelle.


    Lastly, under options, you have `raw` which is set to a `language` of
    `json`. It signifies that the API expects the request payload raw data to be
    in JSON format. Make sure to send request body content as JSON. 


    In summary, this "Product - Zelle - Delete" endpoint takes a JSON object
    with four properties (accountId, sessionId, productId, provider) as a body
    payload and is likley to delete a specific product under an account.
