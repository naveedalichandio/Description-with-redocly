  description: >-
    This endpoint, named "Search - Query - Update", is a PUT method used to
    update the search queries. 


    1. **Auth**: 

    - This endpoint is secured with a bearer authentication, which uses a token
    to validate the request. 

    - The `token` key should hold the token value. This value should be a
    string.


    2. **Method**: 

    - PUT method, which is used to update the existing data on the server. 


    3. **URL**: 

    - The server's domain is "http://localhost:3000/api/search/query/update".
      
    4. **Headers**: 

    - There's a mandatory header "Client-UUID". It should contain a unique id to
    identify the client making requests.


    5. **Body**: 

    - The body of the request should be in `raw` mode and formatted as a JSON
    string. 

    - This JSON should include the following keys: 

      - `queryId` : The unique id for the query.
      - `sessionId` : The unique id corresponding to the search session.
      - `accountId` : The unique id corresponding to the user account. 
      - `metrics` : A JSON object that captures different metric data such as:
        - `device` : An object having keys representing different devices. Here, `tablet` is used as a key and its value represents the number of times it's been used.
        - `browser` : Similar to the device, here `chrome` is an example. 
        - `region` : It captures the geographical location of the user. Here, `us` is an example.
        - `year`, `month`, `week`, `day`, `hour`: These define the time of the search query. It can be used to sort or filter queries based on time.
    - The `options` after the body defines the raw data language. In this case,
    it's JSON.
       
    Remember, all these keys in the body are mandatory and should be
    appropriately filled to successfully update the search query.
