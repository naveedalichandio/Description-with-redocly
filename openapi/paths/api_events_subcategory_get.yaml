  description: >-
    This endpoint, which is titled "Events - SubCategory - Get By Name", is
    responsible for retrieving subcategories of events by their particular
    names. Here's a detailed description of each field and its data.


    1. "name" : This field denotes the name of the API endpoint which is "Events
    - SubCategory - Get By Name". This is useful for identifying and
    categorizing the endpoint in the collection.


    2. "request" : This field contains all the information needed to make a
    request to this endpoint.


    3. "auth": This section deals with the authorization needed to access the
    endpoint. It has three sub-fields:
      - "type": The type of authorization used, which in this case is a "bearer" token.
      - "bearer": This is an array of tokens required for bearer authorization:
        - "key": The name of the bearer token which is "token" in this case.
        - "value": The value of the bearer token.
        - "type": Specifies the datatype of the bearer token, as "string".

    4. "method": It indicates the HTTP verb that should be used when accessing
    this endpoint. Here, you should use a "GET" request.


    5. "url": It describes the address where the request should be sent. For
    this endpoint, the URL is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/events/subcategory/get/?name=eventSubCategoryName".
    Here, "eventSubCategoryName" parameter is passed along with the URL to fetch
    the specific subcategory data by name.


    6. "headers" : This is a list of headers that should be sent along with the
    request. The default header key and value are left empty and set to disabled
    as it's not necessary for this request.


    7. "body": This section concerns the body of the request. 
      - "mode": Indicates how the body should be sent. In this case, it has the value "raw", which means the body should be sent as a raw data string.
      - "raw": This sub-field is used to send raw data. However, as it's a GET request, there's no need to send any data in the body and hence it is left as an empty string.

    Please ensure to replace the "BearerToken" and "eventSubCategoryName" values
    with valid information before making the request to the endpoint.
