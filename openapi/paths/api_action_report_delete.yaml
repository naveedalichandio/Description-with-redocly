    **Endpoint Name**: Action - Report - Delete


    **Description**: This endpoint is designed for deleting a report from the
    system. It requires proper authentication and specific details to
    successfully execute the deletion.


    **Request Details**:

    - **Authentication**:
      - **Type**: Bearer
      - **Bearer Token**: The authorization uses a bearer token, which is a common method for accessing secure APIs. The token required is a "sessionId" that validates the user's session.

    - **HTTP Method**: POST  
      - This method indicates that data is being sent to the server to perform an actionâ€”in this case, to delete a report.

    - **URL**: 
      - The endpoint URL is `http://localhost:3000/api/action/report/delete`. This is the address to which the request will be sent for report deletion.

    - **Headers**:
      - There are currently no custom headers specified. The default header setup is disabled, meaning it will not be sent with the request. Customize if necessary for your application.

    - **Body**:
      - **Mode**: Raw
      - **Content**: The body of the request is sent as a raw JSON string. It contains:
        - **sessionId**: A string identifier for the user's current session, which is necessary for authentication.
        - **accountId**: A string identifier for the account associated with the report. This informs the system which user's report is being targeted.
        - **reportId**: A string identifier for the specific report that needs to be deleted. This tells the system exactly which report to remove.

    This detailed information should help users understand how to use the
    "Action - Report - Delete" endpoint effectively.
