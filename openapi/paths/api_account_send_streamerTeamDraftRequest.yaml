  summary: Account - Send - Streamer Team Draft Request Email
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Account - Send - Streamer Team Draft Request Email".
    It is designed to send a team draft request email through the streamer
    account. Here's a detailed description of all components of the endpoint:


    1. Auth: This endpoint uses bearer token authentication, which means that
    the server and client could pass a `token` as the value of the bearer token
    to authenticate each other. The type of the `token` is string.


    2. Request Method: The HTTP method used by this endpoint is `POST`, which
    means it submits data to be processed to a specified resource.


    3. URL: This HTTP request is sent to the URL:
    `http://localhost:3000/api/account/send/streamerTeamDraftRequest`.


    4. Headers: This HTTP request contains headers, which allow the client to
    pass additional information about the request or about itself, to the
    server. The `Client-UUID` is sent as a header with the type set to
    `default`. Replace `ClientUUID` with the unique identifier of the client.


    5. Body: The body of this request contains the data to be sent to the
    server. The data is sent in `raw` mode which contains the following
    parameters:
      
        - `sessionId`: A unique identifier for the session.
      
        - `accountId`: The account identifier of the user.
      
        - `ownerId`: The unique identifier of the owner. The value `KALSDF98-OJOASDF9=OASKDHFL-OIUAHSD89=ASDFDSS` is just a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual ownerId.

    Make sure to replace the placeholder data with actual values when making the
    request.
