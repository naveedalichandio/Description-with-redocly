    This endpoint's name is "Notification - Tokens - Delete". 


    The Request section contains the following data:


    - **auth**: This is where the authentication method is described. The type
    of authentication used here is "bearer". This typically involves sending a
    token in the HTTP headers to authenticate requests. Here, a token with the
    key 'token' is used as a bearer token. The value associated with this key is
    'sessionId' and its type is a string.


    - **method**: The HTTP method used for this request is 'POST', which is
    usually used to send data to the server.


    - **url**: This is the URL for the service that handles this request. In
    this case, it's "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/tokens/delete".


    For the **headers** of this request, the key and value are both empty, and
    the type is default. This header is disabled, which means it does not add
    any additional data to the request.


    The **body** contains the actual content of the message. Here, the mode is
    'raw', indicating that no special formatting is applied to the data. It
    includes a raw JSON string that contains three key-value pairs:

    1. "sessionId": The session identifier. This is usually used to recognize
    the user on subsequent requests.

    2. "accountId": The account identifier, used to specify for which account
    the notification tokens should be deleted.

    3. "tokensId": The tokens identifier, representing the specific notification
    tokens to be deleted.
