    This endpoint is labelled "Reports - Earning - Get All". It is designed to
    generate a report of all earnings. Here's a breakdown of the different data
    elements in this endpoint:


    1. **auth**: The endpoint uses a Bearer token for authorization. This means
    you need to provide a specific token in the request header to access this
    API endpoint. The Bearer token is of the type 'string' and named "token".


    2. **method**: The HTTP method used for this API request is GET. This means
    the API will retrieve data based on the given request.


    3. **url**: This is the URL where the request will be sent. It is
    http://localhost:3000/api/reports/earning/all/. Two query parameters are
    included: `sessionId` and `accountId`. You need to replace 'sessionId' and
    'accountId' with actual values representing the session ID and account ID
    respectively, for the request to work correctly.


    4. **headers**: No specific headers are required for this request. A default
    empty header is included but it's currently disabled.


    5. **body**: As indicated by 'raw' in 'mode' field, this GET request does
    not require a body payload to be sent along with the request. It's expected
    to retrieve data solely based on the URL and parameters provided.


    Remember to replace "BearerToken", "sessionId", and "accountId" with actual
    values when implementing this API call.
