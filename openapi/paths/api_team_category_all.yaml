    - **Name**: This is the identifier for the API endpoint, indicating that it
    retrieves all categories associated with a specific account ID within a
    team.


    - **Request**: This section outlines how to make the request to the API.

      - **Auth**: This specifies the authentication method required to access the endpoint.
        - **Type**: The authentication type is set to "bearer," which means that a token is required for authentication.
        - **Bearer**: This contains the token required to authenticate the request.
          - **Key**: The key here is "token," identifying the type of bearer token.
          - **Value**: This holds the actual token value needed for authentication, represented as "BearerToken," which should be replaced by a valid token when making the request.
          - **Type**: This indicates the data type of the token, which is a string.

      - **Method**: The HTTP method for this request is "GET," indicating that this endpoint is used to retrieve data.

      - **URL**: This is the endpoint URL that needs to be called to get the data.
        - The URL includes a query parameter:
          - **accountId**: This parameter is required and should be replaced with the specific account ID for which the categories are being requested.

      - **Headers**: This section can include additional headers for the request.
        - Currently, there is an empty key for a header, indicating no additional headers are being used. The header is marked as "disabled," which means it will not be sent with the request.

      - **Body**: This part of the request holds data to be sent to the server.
        - **Mode**: The body mode is set to "raw," meaning that the body can contain raw data.
        - **Raw**: In this case, the raw body is empty since this is a GET request, which typically does not require a body.
