    **Request Method:**  

    This endpoint uses the HTTP GET method to retrieve information.


    **URL:**  

    The request is made to `http://localhost:3000/api/action/join/get/`. The URL

    with the join action.

    - `accountId`: This parameter is used to identify the account related to the
    join action.


    **Authentication:**  

    The request requires Bearer token authentication. The authentication details
    are as follows:

    - **Type:** bearer

    - **Token:** A string value which is a placeholder for the actual token
    required to access this endpoint. Replace "BearerToken" with the actual
    token.


    **Headers:**  

    There are currently no headers specified for this request since the key and
    value fields are empty and the header is disabled. If needed, headers can be
    added based on requirements.


    **Body:**  

    The body of the request is set to raw mode but is currently empty. Since
