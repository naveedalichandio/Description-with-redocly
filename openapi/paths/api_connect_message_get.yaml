    "Connect - Message - Get" is the name of the API endpoint. This name is used
    to identify the specific API operation.


    The "request" object stands for the details of the HTTP request being made
    to the endpoint. 


    Under the "request" object, "auth" specifies the authentication method for
    the API request. The "type" is set to "bearer", which means that it uses
    bearer token authentication. The "bearer" array contains an object with
    "key" as "token" and "value" as "BearerToken". The "type" is set to
    "string". This means a token string called "BearerToken" is expected as a
    part of the API access token for authentication.


    The "method" denotes that this HTTP request is a "GET" method. 


    The "url" is the actual endpoint where the request will hit. In this case,
    it's "http://localhost:3000/api/connect/message/get/?messageId=messageId".
    The "messageId" is a dynamic value which you can replace with the actual
    message Id you want to fetch.


    Under "headers", the "key" and "value" fields are empty in the provided
    object, and it is currently disabled. This typically serves to provide
    additional information for HTTP requests.


    Lastly, "body" is used for the data sent by a HTTP request. In this case,
    the "mode" is set to "raw", and the "raw" field is empty. This implies there
    is no data body being sent with the request. This is not unusual for a GET
    request as these usually retrieve data from the specified URL, rather than
    sending information to it.
