    ### Endpoint: Web - Socket - Recent Account


    #### Method

    - **GET**: This is a HTTP method used to request data from the specified
    resource. In this case, it retrieves data related to recent accounts.


    #### URL

    - **http://localhost:3000/api/socket/web/account?recent=true&limit=limit**:
    This is the endpoint where the request is sent. It consists of the following
    components:
      - **localhost:3000**: Refers to the server address; "localhost" indicates that the server is running on your local machine, and "3000" is the port number.
      - **/api/socket/web/account**: This is the path to the resource on the server. It defines the specific API endpoint for accessing account data.
      - **?recent=true**: This is a query parameter indicating that only recent accounts should be retrieved. Setting this to true filters the results to show only accounts that have been recently active.
      - **&limit=limit**: This is another query parameter that specifies how many recent accounts to return. The actual number should replace the word "limit" in the query string.

    #### Headers

    - **headers**: This is an array where you can specify any HTTP headers that
    may be needed for the request. In this case, it is empty indicating that no
    additional headers are required for this request. 


    This endpoint allows users to access a list of recent accounts through a
    WebSocket connection, providing the option to limit the number of accounts
    returned based on the specified limit.
