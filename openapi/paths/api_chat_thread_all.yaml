    This endpoint, "Chat - Thread - Get All By Thread With Deleted", allows you
    to retrieve all threads, including deleted ones, associated with a specific
    chat. There are different components of the data in this endpoint.


    1. "auth": This represents the authentication section. It uses bearer token
    authentication. 
       - "type" denotes the type of the authorization, here it is "bearer".
       - "bearer" denotes the array containing authentication token, with three properties: "key", "value", and "type". 
       - "key" is "token".
       - "value" - This should hold the value of the bearer token required for authorization.
       - "type" indicates the data type of token, which is "string".

    2. "method": This property denotes the HTTP method used for the request.
    Here, "GET" method is used which is typically for retrieving data.


    3. "url": This is the URL for the API endpoint. It points to the specific
    location in your application where the request should go. Here, it's
    "http://localhost:3000/api/chat/thread/all/?threadId=threadId&deleted=1".
    The URL contains two query parameters "threadId" and "deleted". 
       - "threadId" is parameter used to specify the particular Thread you're looking to access.
       - "deleted" parameter is set to 1, indicating that deleted messages are also to be fetched.

    4. "headers": Contains an array of objects with information to be sent as
    headers with the request. Currently, it is empty and disabled. 


    5. "body": Contains the format and content of the body of the request. In
    this endpoint, it's indicated as 'raw' mode, which means you can send
    whatever data you wish. But here the raw data is empty string denoting no
    additional data is sent with this request. 


    Please remember to replace 'BearerToken' and 'threadId' with your actual
    bearer token and thread ID while using it.
