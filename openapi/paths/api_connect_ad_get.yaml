  summary: Connect - Ads - Get
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Connect - Ads - Get". This is a call to fetch
    specific advertisement data based upon the adId provided. Here is a more
    detailed explanation of its components:


    1. `name`: The name of the endpoint. It is denoted as "Connect - Ads - Get".
    It indicates the operation of connecting and fetching data related to ads.


    2. `request`: This indicates an HTTP request that is to be sent. 


    3. `auth`: The authentication type used for this request. It is using
    'bearer' authentication which means that a bearer token will be used to
    validate the request. The `token` key is the actual location where the
    bearer token must be inserted. The token value should be of string type.


    4. `method`: This is the HTTP method type. The "GET" method is used which
    means this request fetches data from the server at the specified resource.


    5. `url`: This is the URL where the request will be sent. The base URL is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/connect/ad/get/` and it should be appended by
    `?adId=` followed by the actual id of the ad you want to retrieve.


    6. `headers`: This section is for specifying additional HTTP request
    options. No key-value pair is provided in this request so, by default, no
    additional headers will be included in the request.


    7. `body`: This is the part of HTTP request where additional data is sent
    along with the request. In this case, `mode` is set to 'raw' but no actual
    data is being sent as the `raw` field is empty. So, 'raw' body mode will not
    affect this request.
