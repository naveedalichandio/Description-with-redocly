  summary: Customer - Stripe - Get All
  description: >-
    This API endpoint is labeled as "Customer - Stripe - Get All". This suggests
    it's designed to retrieve all customer data associated with the Stripe
    payment platform.


    - Method: The request 'GET' method indicates it's utilized to retrieve data.


    - URL: The URL "http://localhost:3000/api/payment/customer/getAll/"
    indicates the location of the API on the server. It consists of several
    parts:
      - The base URL 'http://localhost:3000/' is the root address which points to your local server running at port 3000.
      - 'api' signifies that it's an API endpoint.
      - 'payment' could imply the financial transaction category being targeted.
      - 'customer' suggests that the API is associated with customer data.
      - 'getAll' refers to the functionality of the endpoint, meaning it's responsible for fetching all customers from the Stripe payment system.

    - Query Parameters: These are present in the URL after the '?'. They are
    used to filter and manipulate the response data based on the server's logic.
    The endpoint requires three query parameters i.e., accountId, provider, and
    sessionId.
       - 'accountId' is likely a unique identifier for each distinct account.
       - 'provider' refers to the payment platform in use, which in this case is 'stripe'.
       - 'sessionId' is probably a unique identifier for the current session, which could be used for tracking or maintaining session-specific information safely.

    - Headers: The 'headers' field is currently empty in this endpoint.
    Normally, they would be used to provide additional request info like auth
    tokens or the formatting of the data being sent. It's noted to be blank
    here, suggesting that no additional information is required for this API
    request at this time. 


    It should be noted that this is a generalized explanation based on the data
    provided and the actual functionality might vary depending on the server
    side implementation and business logic.
