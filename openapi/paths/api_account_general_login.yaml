    This endpoint is named "Account - General - Login Phone". It is a POST
    request used for authenticating a user's phone-based login on the
    account/general resource.


    The endpoint uses Bearer Authentication. The bearer token is denoted by the
    "token" key with the string type value "BearerToken". This token is passed
    as a header in the format: Bearer (Access token).


    The URL for the endpoint is http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/login.
    It represents a local server environment which receives the request, handles
    it by checking the account's general data, and authenticates login.


    This endpoint doesn't require any additional headers as highlighted in the
    headers field with the key and value set as default and empty, but it's not
    active as the disabled property is set to true.


    The request body is in JSON format, and it should be sent in raw mode. The
    data in the body should include two properties: "phone" and "password". Both
    are strings that represent a user's phone number and password respectively.
    These inputs are essential for the phone-based login protocol.


    Please note that this endpoint's functionality, response, or actions will
    vary depending on the handled data server-side. Make sure to replace the
    placeholders ("BearerToken," "phone," and "password") with actual
    user-specific values while testing or using this endpoint.
