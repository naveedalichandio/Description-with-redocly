    ### Action - Dislike - Create


    #### Request Details:

    - **Request Type**: This endpoint is for a POST request, used for creating a
    new "dislike" action.


    - **Authentication**: The request uses bearer token authentication. This
    requires the user to provide a valid token in the request header for
    authorization to access the resource.


    #### URL:

    - **Endpoint**: The endpoint to access this action is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/action/dislike/create`. This should be changed to
    the appropriate server URL in production.


    #### Headers:

    - **Headers**: There are no specific headers set in the request at this
    time. The default headers are disabled and not in use.


    #### Body:

    The body of the request is sent in raw JSON format and contains the
    following key-value pairs:


    1. **sessionId**: This is a string that identifies the session in which the
    dislike action is being recorded. It helps in tracking the user's current
    state or interaction session.


    2. **accountId**: This represents the unique identifier for the user account
    making the dislike action. It is essential for associating the dislike with
    the correct user.


    3. **path**: This is a string that indicates the path of the content being
    disliked. For example, it points to the location of the video, such as
    `/live/channel/video123`.


    4. **targetType**: Specifies the type of target that the dislike is directed
    toward. In this case, it is set to `videoId`, indicating that the action
    pertains to a video.


    5. **targetId**: This is the unique identifier of the content that is being
    disliked. In this example, it is labeled `videoId`, representing the
    specific video the user is interacting with.


    6. **sourceType**: Denotes the type of the source from which the dislike
    action is being made. It is set to `accountId`, indicating that the action
    originates from a user account.


    7. **sourceId**: This is the unique identifier associated with the source.
    It is also set to `accountId`, signifying the identity of the user making
    the dislike action.


    8. **didDislike**: A boolean value that indicates whether the user disliked
    the content or not. Here, it is set to `false`, suggesting that the action
    is intended to indicate a dislike (i.e., changing from a non-dislike state).


    9. **isUndo**: This is another boolean value. If it is set to `true`, it
    means the user is undoing a previous dislike action. It is set to `false`,
    indicating that this is a fresh dislike action rather than an undoing of a
    previous one.


    10. **name**: This is an optional field that can hold a name or title
    related to the dislike action. Currently, it is an empty string, awaiting
    user-defined input if necessary.


    11. **description**: Another optional field, intended for additional
    information or notes regarding the dislike action. It is currently left
    empty.


    12. **tags**: This optional field allows for additional tagging related to
    the dislike action. It is also an empty string and can be used to categorize
    or provide more context if needed.


    This endpoint is designed to create a dislike action against a specific
    piece of content, capturing relevant information about the user and the
    disliked item.
