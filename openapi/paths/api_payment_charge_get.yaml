  summary: Charge - Stripe - Get
  description: >-
    This endpoint named "Charge - Stripe - Get" is a GET type HTTP request that
    calls to retrieve specific data from the Stripe payment system. 


    The request is executed through the URL:
    http://localhost:3000/api/payment/charge/get/ which holds the application
    host and the API path. This endpoint is related to fetching information
    about a charge from the Stripe payment system.


    Embedded in the URL are four query parameters which are crucial pieces of
    data to consider:


    1. "chargeId" - This required query parameter refers to the unique
    identifier of a specific charge in the Stripe payment system. It helps to
    retrieve the details for that particular transaction.


    2. "provider" - This required query parameter specifies the payment gateway.
    In this case, it's set to 'stripe'. This way, the system knows that the
    Stripe provider should handle the request.


    3. "accountId" - This required query parameter is the unique ID of the user
    account associated with the charge. It helps to link the charge to a
    specific user within the system.


    4. "sessionId" - This is a required query parameter which is used for
    session tracking. It uniquely identifies the user's current active session. 


    At last, this endpoint doesn't contain any specific headers, which means any
    standard or default headers your HTTP client sets are all that are sent.
