    This endpoint is named "Media - Video - Create - For Reward" and its
    function is to create a new video media for a particular reward. The request
    is authenticated using a bearer token, which is a type of HTTP
    authentication method. 


    The request method is POST, which means it's used to send data to the server
    to create a new resource. The endpoint URL where this data is sent is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/media/video/create".


    There are headers included in the request but they are currently disabled
    and not holding any key-value pair.


    The body of the request contains the data that you are sending to the
    server. This data is being sent in raw JSON format which has the following
    elements:


    - `sessionId`: The unique ID for the session. This is a string.

    - `accountId`: The unique ID for the account involved in creating the media.
    This also is a string.

    - `rewardId`: The unique ID for the reward for which this media is being
    created. This is also a string.

    - `name`: The name of the media being created.

    - `description`: A brief description of the media being created.

    - `tags`: Tags attached to the media for categorizing or labeling. Multiple
    tags are separated by comas.

    - `contentType`: The MIME type of the content. In this case, it's
    `application/webm` which is typically used for web video files.

    - `contentLength`: The length of the content, expressed in bytes. In this
    case, it's set to 0, indicating the length is yet to be determined.  

    - `targetKey`: The key specifying where the media is to be used in the
    user's profile.

    - `compressUsing`: The method of compression used, in this case 'Base64'.

    - `isCompressed`: Determines if the media file is compressed. A boolean
    value, true indicates that it is compressed.

    - `isPrivate`: Determines if the media file is private or publicly
    accessible. A boolean value, false indicates that it is publicly accessible.

    - `data`: The actual content of the media in string format, represented by
    '...'. 


    Finally, the body has additional options for raw data wherein the language
    being used is specified, in this case, JSON.
