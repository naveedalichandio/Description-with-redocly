  description: >-
    This endpoint `Connect - Contact - Get All` is a GET Request which retrieves
    all the contact information tied to the specified `accountId`. Below is the
    detailed description of each element in the endpoint:


    - `name`: The title of the endpoint. It's called "Connect - Contact - Get
    All", which suggests that we are retrieving all the contact details
    associated with an account in the Connect service.


    - `request`: This is the main part that defines what the request does.

      - `auth`: This section represents the type of authentication required for this endpoint. The "auth" stands for "authentication".
        
        - `type`: The type of the token used for the authentication. In this case, it is a "bearer" which is a method to send authentication data to the server.
        
        - `bearer`: This is an array that holds the authentication token details. The `key` attribute indicates how this token is referred in the headers - as 'token'. While the `value` attribute holds the variable 'BearerToken' which stores the actual token value. The `type` must always be a string.

      - `method`: This refers to the HTTP verb used for this request. Here, it's a "GET" request, meaning you are retrieving information from the server.

      - `url`: It contains the location to which the request is sent. `http://localhost:3000/api/connect/contact/all/?accountId=accountId` indicates that request is sending to the localhost on port 3000. The path `/api/connect/contact/all` indicates that we are accessing the 'all' operation in the 'contact' resource of the 'connect' service. The `accountId` is a query parameter that should hold the actual id of the account for which we want to fetch the contact information. 

      - `headers`: The headers that should be included in the HTTP request. In this case, there's a `key` and `value` pair which is set to empty by default and has been `disabled`. It means, we can disregard this from request headers as it has no impact on the current request

      - `body`: This is usually where you specify the content of your request. However, for this GET Request, the body has `mode` set to 'raw' and `raw` set to an empty string, meaning, it doesn't need to send any additional data in the request body.
      
    This endpoint will respond with all the contact information related to the
    provided `accountId`.
