    copy action based on the provided identifiers. 


    #### Request Details:

      - **Type:** Bearer Token
        - This method requires authentication through a bearer token, which must be included in the request for access to the resource.

    - **Method:** 
      - **GET:** This HTTP method is used to request data from the specified resource.

    - **URL:** 
      - `http://localhost:3000/api/action/copy/get/?copyId=copyId&sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId`
        - This is the endpoint URL for the API. It contains placeholders that need to be replaced with actual values before making the request:
          - `copyId`: The unique identifier for the copy action you want to retrieve.
          - `sessionId`: The identifier for the session related to the copy action.
          - `accountId`: The identifier for the account associated with the copy action.
          
    - **Headers:**
      - **Key:** *(Not specified)*
        - Currently, no headers are included in the request. You can add additional headers if necessary. The entry is disabled and does not influence the request.

    - **Body:**
      - **Mode:** Raw
        - This indicates the body of the request is not being used since it's a GET method. 
      - **Raw:** *(Empty)*
        - There are no raw body data elements included since a GET request does not require body content.

    **Note for Users:** Ensure to replace the placeholders in the URL with
    actual values when making the request. Authentication is mandatory, and you
    must obtain a valid bearer token to access this endpoint.
