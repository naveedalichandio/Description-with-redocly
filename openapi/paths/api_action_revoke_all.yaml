    #### Request Details


    - **Authentication**: 
      - **Type**: Bearer Token
      - **Key**: `token`
      - **Value**: The actual token should be prefixed with `Bearer ` followed by the token value. This is used to authorize the request and ensure that the caller has the necessary permissions to access the endpoint.

    - **HTTP Method**: 
      - **Method**: GET

    - **Headers**: 
      - A placeholder for any additional headers required by the request. In this case, the header is currently disabled and does not carry any value or key.

    - **Body**:
