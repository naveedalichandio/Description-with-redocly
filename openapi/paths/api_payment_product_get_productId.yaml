  description: >-
    This endpoint is titled "Product - Zelle - Get". It is designed to retrieve
    information about a specific product from the Zelle payment interface. The
    information retrieved is based on the unique identifier of the product.


    The request involves three properties:


    - Method: This is a GET request. This is a type of HTTP method used to
    retrieve data from a server.


    - URL: This is the specific location where the request is sent. It is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/payment/product/get/productId"


    There are three important parameters within the URL which need to be
    substituted with actual values:


    1. "productId": This refers to a unique identifier of a product in the Zelle
    interface. Replace 'productId' with the actual identifier of the product you
    intend to access.


    2. "provider": This refers to the provider of the payment service, in this
    case, it is 'zelle'. It is already filled hence doesn't need to be
    substituted.


    3. "accountId": This is the specific account related to the payment product.
    Replace 'accountId' with the actual account ID.


    4. "sessionId": This is the session during which the request is made.
    Replace 'sessionId' with the actual session ID.


    - Headers: This refers to the metadata sent with the API request. As
    depicted, no specific headers are attached with the request. Therefore, no
    specific data is required here. However, different API requests may require
    different headers.


    Please remember to replace these placeholders (i.e. productId, accountId,
    sessionId) with your actual values when using this endpoint.
