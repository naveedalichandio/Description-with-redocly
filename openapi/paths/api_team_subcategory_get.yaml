    ### Endpoint: Team - SubCategory - Get By Account ID


    #### Overview

    This API endpoint retrieves subcategory information associated with a
    specific account ID. It uses the HTTP GET method and requires an
    authorization token.


    #### Detailed Description of Each Data Field:


    - **name**: 
      - This is the name of the API endpoint. It identifies the specific action being performed, which is to get subcategory details for a team based on an account ID.

    - **request**: 
      - This object contains all the necessary details for making the API request.

      - **auth**: 
        - This section specifies the authorization method used for the request.
        
        - **type**: 
          - Indicates the type of authentication. In this case, it is a 'bearer' token.
          
        - **bearer**: 
          - An array which holds the authorization token needed to authenticate the request.
          
          - **key**: 
            - This is a placeholder for the token key. It is labeled 'token' which indicates that this is where your access token will be placed.
            
          - **value**: 
            - This is the actual token value, prefixed with 'Bearer'. Replace 'BearerToken' with the actual bearer token for successful authentication.
            
          - **type**: 
            - This specifies the data type of the token, which is 'string'.

      - **method**: 
        - This indicates the HTTP method used for the API request. The method here is 'GET', which is intended to retrieve data.

      - **url**: 
        - This is the endpoint URL that should be called. It includes a parameter for the account ID, which should be replaced with the actual account ID value when making a request.

      - **headers**: 
        - This is a collection of headers to be sent with the API request. 

        - **key**: 
          - Represents the name of the header. Currently, it is empty and disabled, which means no additional headers are being sent.
          
        - **value**: 
          - Represents the value of the header. Since the key is empty, this is also not set.
          
        - **type**: 
          - Denotes the type of the header. It is set to 'default'.

        - **disabled**: 
          - This boolean flag indicates whether the header is active. It is currently set to true, which means this header will not be sent.

      - **body**: 
        - This section defines the body of the request. 

        - **mode**: 
          - Indicates the type of body content. It is set to 'raw', suggesting that the body content will be sent as a raw string.
        
        - **raw**: 
          - This is where the actual body content would go if required. Currently, it is empty, meaning no data will be sent in the request body since this is a GET request.

    #### Usage
