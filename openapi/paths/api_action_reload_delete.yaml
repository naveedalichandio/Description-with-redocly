    ### Endpoint: Action - Reload - Delete


    #### Request Details


    - **Auth**: 
      - **Type**: Bearer Authentication is used to authorize access to the API. 
      - **Bearer Details**: A token is required for the request, which will be passed as a `sessionId`. 

    - **Method**: 
      - **POST**: This endpoint uses the HTTP POST method to send data to the server.

    - **URL**: 
      - The request will be sent to `http://localhost:3000/api/action/reload/delete`, which is the local host address where the API is hosted. 

    - **Headers**: 
      - Currently, there are no custom headers specified. There is an empty header field that is disabled, meaning it will not be sent with the request.

    - **Body**: 
      - **Mode**: The body is in "raw" format, which allows for sending JSON data directly.
      - **Raw Data**: The JSON payload being sent contains the following keys:
        - **sessionId**: This represents the unique identifier for the user session that is currently active.
        - **accountId**: This represents the unique identifier for the account linked to the session or action.
        - **reloadId**: This signifies the unique identifier for the reload action that is to be deleted. 

    This endpoint is designed to send a request to delete a specific reload
    action associated with a user session and account. Make sure to properly
    replace the placeholder values with actual identifiers when making a
    request.
