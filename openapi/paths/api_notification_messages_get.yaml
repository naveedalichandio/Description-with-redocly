    This endpoint is called "Notification - Messages - Get". This endpoint is
    primarily used to retrieve notification messages. 


    1. **Authentication**: 
       This endpoint uses Bearer token authentication. The key for the token is "token", which needs to be a string value. Provide the authentication token with the "BearerToken" value to get authorized access.

    2. **Request Method**: 
       This endpoint uses the GET HTTP method. GET is used to request data from a specified resource on a server.

    3. **URL**: 
       The URL for this endpoint is "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/messages/get". It takes three parameters i.e., "messagesId", "sessionId", and "accountId". All three parameters should be added to the URL, right after the "?" mark, each separated by an "&".

    4. **Headers**: 
       The headers field is currently set to default and disabled. When enabled, it gets set to a key-value pair specifying characteristics of the data being sent or requested.

    5. **Body**: 
       The current body mode for this endpoint is set to "raw". At this mode, the endpoint does not expect any data to be sent within the body of the request. 

    Please replace the 'BearerToken', 'messagesId', 'sessionId', and 'accountId'
    with actual values before using it. The 'BearerToken' needs to be replaced
    with a valid authentication token. 'messagesId', 'sessionId', and
    'accountId' are specific to individual accounts and sessions.
