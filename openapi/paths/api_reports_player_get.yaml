    - **name**: This denotes the name or title of this endpoint, which in this
    case is 'Reports - Player - Get'. This is usually used for identifying the
    API endpoint in a collection or documentation.


    - **request.auth**: The 'auth' field represents the type of authorization
    required to send a request to this endpoint. This endpoint requires Bearer
    Token authorization. The generated token needs to be passed here as a
    string.


    - **request.method**: This is the HTTP method used for the request. Since
    the method here is 'GET', this endpoint corresponds to retrieving data from
    a server.


    - **request.url**: This is the URL where the request will be sent. It
    includes the base URL (http://localhost:3000/api/reports/player/get/) and
    query parameters playerId, sessionId, and accountId to identify the specific
    player, session, and account.


    - **request.headers**: Headers can contain more information about the
    request. For this endpoint, no additional headers are required as the
    'disabled' value is set to 'true'.


    - **request.body**: Here we define what data to send within the body of the
    HTTP request. For this 'GET' request, there is no body. The mode is 'raw'
    which means that if data were to be sent, it would be sent in unprocessed
    form. For this endpoint, however, no 'raw' data is to be sent. 


    Remember to replace the BearerToken string in the auth field, and playerId,
    sessionId, accountId in the URL with actual values for a successful request.
