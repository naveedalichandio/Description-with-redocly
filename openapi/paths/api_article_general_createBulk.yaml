  summary: Article - General - Create Bulk Auto
  description: >
    The endpoint `Article - General - Create Bulk Auto` is a HTTP `POST` request
    used to create multiple ("bulk") articles in the system.


    The `auth` object is how the API handles authentication. It uses a `type` of
    "bearer", which means it's expecting a bearer token in the request header.
    The `bearer` array holds key-value pair objects, where the `key` is the
    "token" and its corresponding `value` is the "BearerToken" we provide.


    The `url` is the path where the request is sent. In this case, it's a local
    development server (`localhost`) on port `3000`.


    The `headers` object in the request is currently empty and has `disabled`
    set to `true`, which means no specific HTTP headers are set for this
    request.


    The `body` encompasses the actual content of the request. It is sent as
    `raw` JSON. 


    The data in the `body` includes:


    - `sessionId`: The unique identifier for the ongoing session.

    - `accountId`: The unique identifier for the user's account.

    - `articles`: An array of objects, with each object representing an
    individual article and containing:
      - `title`: The article's title.
      - `category`: The category the article belongs to.
      - `subCategory`: Subcategory of the article.
      - `topic`: Topic of the article.
      - `date`: The date of the article.
      - `author`: Author of the article.
      - `estimatedTime`: Estimated reading time of the article.
      - `image`: URL of the image related to the article.
      - `content`: An array representing sections of the article's content. Each section is an object that includes a `type` (either "text" or "section"), `title` (for "section" type), and `content`.
      - `tags`: An array of tags associated with the article.

    Note: The `title` of each article must be unique in the bulk creation. The
    `date` needs to be in a recognized format like "DD MM YYYY". The `image` URL
    needs to be a valid, publicly accessible URL.


    The `options` object (inside `body`) defines the language of the `raw` input
    as `json`.


    In summary, this endpoint allows the bulk creation of articles based on the
    provided JSON data, including details as article title, category,
    sub-category, author, estimated reading time, image URL, content, and tags.
    It requires a bearer token for authentication.
