  summary: Product - Zelle - Create
  description: >-
    This endpoint is labeled "Product - Zelle - Create", signifying that its
    main function is to create a new product under the payment service, Zelle.
    It uses the POST method to send data to the specified URL
    "http://localhost:3000/api/payment/product/create".


    The endpoint accepts a JSON object as its body. The details of the body
    content are as follows:


    - `accountId`: This is a unique identifier for the account that you wish to
    associate with the new product. It should be passed as a string.


    - `sessionId`: This also needs to be a unique identifier that represents the
    user's current session. It's again a string.


    - `source`: The original source where this product data is coming from. It
    can be supplied as a string or null if not available.


    - `isSaveProduct`: A boolean indicating whether or not you want to save this
    product after creation. If this value is true, the created product will be
    saved to the account. If false, the product will not be saved.


    - `isPrimary`: Another boolean flag that tells us whether this product
    should be set as the primary product for the given account. True would mean
    it is considered a primary product and false would mean it is not.


    - `provider`: This signifies the provider of the product. In this case, it
    is to be set as "zelle".


    Remember, there's no specific headers required for this endpoint, however it
    is case sensitive, so be sure to use the exact same cases as detailed above.


    The endpoint also contains an options object that includes a language field
    which is set to "json". This ensures that the raw body is treated and
    processed as a JSON object when received.


    Overall, use this endpoint when you need to create a new product tied with a
    Zelle payment system, that you can specify as primary or non-primary and can
    choose to be saved for future use or discarded after creation.
