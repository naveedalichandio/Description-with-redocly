  summary: Article - Category - Get All By Account ID
  description: >-
    This endpoint, named "Article - Category - Get All By Account ID", is used
    to retrieve all articles by a specific account ID via a GET request. The
    details of each segment in this endpoint are as follows:


    1. "name": This is the key that refers to the name of the API endpoint. In
    this case, it is "Article - Category - Get All By Account ID".


    2. "request": This is where the configuration of the API request is defined.
    It includes:


    - "auth": This defines the type of authorization required to access this
    endpoint. The endpoint uses 'Bearer token' authorization. The token is
    provided in the "bearer" field with a key named "token" and a value of
    "BearerToken".


    - "method": Method used to get the information for the API. It's a 'GET'
    request which is used when you want to retrieve data.


    - "url": This is the URL which the request will be sent to. It is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/article/category/all/?accountId=accountId". The
    accountId at the end indicates where you would replace it with the actual ID
    of the account.


    - "headers": These are metadata in the form of key-value pairs, sent in the
    request. In this case, no headers are defined which is why the key and value
    fields are empty and "disabled" is set to true


    - "body": This is the data that you send to the path in the HTTP protocol.
    However, in this case, it has no content; the mode is "raw" and the raw
    field is empty.


    Remember to replace 'BearerToken' and 'accountId' with actual values in your
    application.
