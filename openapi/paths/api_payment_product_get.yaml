  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Product - Stripe - Get". It is designed to retrieve
    the details of a specific product using the Stripe payment API.


    The endpoint follows the 'GET' HTTP request method, which is used to
    retrieve data from a specified resource.


    The 'url' points to where the API is hosted. In this case, it's hosted on
    the local machine at the port 3000. It consists of various query parameters
    - productId, provider, accountId, and sessionId. 


    The 'productId' is specific to each product and is used to identify which
    product's details need to be fetched from the server. The 'provider' query
    parameter should be set as 'Stripe' to specify that Stripe is the payment
    provider. The 'accountId' is the unique identifier provided by Stripe to
    identify an account. Finally, the 'sessionId,' which represents the session
    in which the user is currently in.


    Though there is an empty 'headers' array, this can be used to include
    additional HTTP headers if required in the future. These can be used to
    provide additional information about the request or about the client
    itself. 


    This API doesn't require a request body since it's using the 'GET' method.
    All data are placed in the URL as query parameters.
