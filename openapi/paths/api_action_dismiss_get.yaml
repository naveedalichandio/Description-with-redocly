    #### Request Details:

      - **Bearer Token**: 
        - A string that contains the token, represented here as "BearerToken." This token should be replaced with an actual token for authentication.

    - **HTTP Method**: 
      - The method used to make the request is GET. This implies that the endpoint is utilized to retrieve data without affecting the state of any resources.

    - **URL**: 
      - The endpoint's URL is structured as follows:
        ```
        http://localhost:3000/api/action/dismiss/get/?dismissId=dismissId&sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId
        ```
        - **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/action/dismiss/get/`
        - **Query Parameters**:
          - `dismissId`: This is a placeholder for the unique identifier of the dismissal you wish to retrieve information about.
          - `sessionId`: This is a placeholder for the identifier associated with the session during which the dismissal action occurred.
          - `accountId`: This is a placeholder for the identifier associated with the account related to the dismissal.

    - **Headers**: 
      - There is a header section included in the request, but it appears to be disabled and empty. Typically, here you would add any additional headers required by the API, like custom content types or security headers.

    - **Body**:
      - The body of the request is set to "raw" mode but is left empty. Since this is a GET request, a body is generally not included. Thus, no data needs to be sent in the body.
