  description: >-
    This endpoint is called "Account - Keys - Get All". It's responsible for
    fetching all the keys related to a particular account.


    Here is a description of all the elements in the endpoint:


    1. **name:** This is the name of the endpoint. This is how you would refer
    to the endpoint in the documentation or when discussing it with other
    developers. In this case, the name indicates that this endpoint is used to
    get all keys for a given account.


    2. **request:** This object contains all information required to make the
    HTTP request.


    3. **auth:** This is the authorization method that is used when making the
    request. For this endpoint, the authorization is of the type "bearer" which
    means it uses a bearer token for authorization. A bearer token is a type of
    access token that is issued to the client.


    4. **bearer:** This is an array of objects that contains the bearer token
    for the request. Each object has a "key", "value", and "type". The "key" is
    the name given to the token, the "value" is the actual value of the token,
    and the "type" is the data type of the token.


    5. **method:** This is the HTTP method used for the request. In this case,
    it's a "GET" request, which means data is being retrieved from the server. 


    6. **url:** This is the URL where the request will be sent. In our case,
    it's
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/keys/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId".
    It includes query parameters for "sessionId" and "accountId", presumably
    used to identify the relevant session and account.


    7. **headers:** This is an array of objects, each representing a header that
    will be included in the request. Currently, the endpoint provides a default
    empty header which is disabled. Headers can include metadata about the
    request or other necessary information.


    8. **body:** This is the body of the request. For this endpoint, the "body"
    is set as "raw", but no data is needed or included as part of the request
    since it's a "GET" request.


    This is a high-level overview of the endpoint data. For all specific data
    usage, please refer to the application's API documentation or any inline
    comments provided in the application code.
