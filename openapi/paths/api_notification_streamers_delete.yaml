  description: >-
    This API endpoint is named "Notification - Streamers - Delete." As the name
    suggests, it's intended to be used for deleting streamer notifications in
    the system.


    To authorize this endpoint, a 'Bearer token' is required. The 'token' is
    represented by 'sessionId' which should be a string value. You need to
    replace 'sessionId' with the actual session ID value.


    The method used for this API endpoint is 'POST' and the URL is
    'http://localhost:3000/api/notification/streamers/delete'. This means it'll
    delete streamer notifications when this API endpoint is called.


    There are no additional headers required for this API endpoint as shown in
    'headers' attribute. The key and value fields are empty and this header
    field is marked as 'disabled', hence it won't impact your API request.


    The request payload or body should be in 'raw' format. In the raw JSON
    object, three parameters are required:

    1. 'sessionId': You have to replace this with your actual session ID for
    valid authorization.

    2. 'accountId': Replace this placeholder with the actual account ID for
    which you want to delete the streamer notifications.

    3. 'streamersId': Replace this placeholder with the actual ID of the
    streamer whose notifications you want to delete.


    Make sure the value you replace these placeholders with correspond to the
    correct data type and are valid in your application context.
