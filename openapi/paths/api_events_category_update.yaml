    This endpoint is named "Events - Category - Update" and is a service URL to
    update the details of a specific event category. 


    1. The `request` object has several properties within it like `auth`,
    `method`, `url`, `headers`, & `body`.

       - The `auth` object describes the authentication method used for this endpoint. This API uses Bearer Token authorization. The field named `token` should contain the actual Bearer Token needed as authorization credentials to connect to the API.

       - The request `method` is `PUT`, which is typically used for updating resources.

       - The `url` is the endpoint's URL to which the request should be sent. This URL is used to update the event category.

       - The `headers` object contains additional elements sent along with the request. This API requires a `Client-UUID` for identification purposes.

    2. The `body` object inside the `request` object carries all the data needed
    to update an event category.

       - The `mode` is `raw`, meaning the data is sent exactly as entered.

       - The `raw` field contains the actual data to be sent. This should be a JSON containing: 
           - `categoryId`: The unique identifier for the category.
           - `sessionId`: The active session's identifier.
           - `accountId`: The user's account identifier.
           - `name`: The new name for the event.
           - `displayName`: The new display name for the event.
           - `description`: A detailed description of the event.
           - `tags`: Relevant tags to associate with the event, separated by commas.

       - The `options` object provides metadata about the body content. It indicates that the language used in the `raw` body is `json`.
