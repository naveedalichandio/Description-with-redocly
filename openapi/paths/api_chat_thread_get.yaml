  summary: Chat - Thread - Get By Owner With Deleted
  description: >-
    This endpoint, called "Chat - Thread - Get By Owner With Deleted," is
    designed to allow you retrieve chat threads from the database. It
    specifically fetches chat threads that are owned by a specific user and
    considers both active and deleted threads. 


    Here's a breakdown of the components:


    1. **name**: This is the title or name of the endpoint, which describes what
    the endpoint does. In this case, "Chat - Thread - Get By Owner With Deleted"
    suggests that this endpoint retrieves chat threads (both deleted and active)
    owned by a user.


    2. **request**: This details the actual request that will be made to the
    endpoint.


    3. **auth**: This section contains authentication details required to get
    access to the endpoint. It's using Bearer authentication, which expects a
    token to be provided. 

       - **type**: It indicates the type of authorization being used which is "bearer" in this case.
       
       - **bearer**: This is an array containing a single object that describes the token needed for authorization:
         - **key**: This field indicates that a "token" is required.
         - **value**: It shows the placeholder for the value of the bearer token.
         - **type**: The data type of the "token", which is a "string".

    4. **method**: The type of HTTP request that is being made. In this case,
    it's a "GET" request, meaning it retrieves data from the server.


    5. **url**: This is the actual URL where the request will be sent. It
    includes three query parameters: threadType, threadTypeId, and deleted,
    which respectively represent the type of thread, ID related with the thread,
    and the status of deletion.


    6. **headers**: The headers field is currently empty and disabled. When
    enabled, it can contain additional information which will be sent with the
    HTTP request. For now, no additional information is being passed.


    7. **body**: The body carries essential data needed in processing the
    request. However, for a GET request, no additional body data is required,
    hence it remains empty.


    Remember to replace the "BearerToken" with a valid token while making an
    actual API call. Also, replace the query parameters in the URL with valid
    threadType, threadTypeId and deleted status to get the desired result.
