    This API endpoint is named "Manage - Admin - Delete". It's designed for
    managing the deletion of admins in your application.


    The API uses the `POST` method to delete information. This action is
    performed by sending a request to this URL:
    `http://localhost:3000/api/manage/admin/delete`.


    The endpoint is secured using Bearer Authentication. This means the client
    must send a Bearer token, which is typically a cryptic string, associated
    with the request. The key for this token is "token" and the value is
    "sessionId". The value will need to be replaced with an actual sessionId for
    it to work.


    The headers object has been left empty for now but is there in case you need
    to include required headers in the future.


    The part of the API that does the heavy lifting is the "body". Here, the
    mode is set to "raw", meaning that the JSON payload will be sent as a raw
    block of data. This block includes three pieces of information:

    - "sessionId": a unique identifier for your session

    - "accountId": a unique identifier for the account under which the admin
    resides

    - "adminId": a unique identifier for the specific admin you want to delete


    Each field takes a string as a value and these strings need to be replaced
    with actual values in order to send the request properly. Also, during the
    deletion, the system uses these identifiers to ensure that the correct admin
    is deleted from the right account and session.


    Please replace `"sessionId"`, `"accountId"`, and `"adminId"` with actual
    values when using this API endpoint.
