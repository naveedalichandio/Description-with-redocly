  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Connect - Comment - Get All". It is designed to
    retrieve all comments associated with a specified account ID from a Connect
    application. The request sent to this endpoint involves several data
    components:


    - "auth": This required field specifies the authentication method for
    accessing this endpoint. For this case, it uses bearer authentication, where
    the credentials are sent in the HTTP header. The bearer token is expected to
    be a string data type. A valid token is required to access this resource.


    - "method": This endpoint utilizes the GET method. It's primarily designed
    to retrieve data from a server.


    - "url": This is where the server needs to send the request. The URL is
    'http://localhost:3000/api/connect/comment/all/?accountId=accountId'. It is
    designed to run on the local server on port 3000. The path
    '/api/connect/comment/all' indicates it's accessing the Connect
    application's comment feature to get all comments. It requires an
    'accountId' query parameter representing the user's account ID.


    - "headers": Headers can be used to pass additional information to/from a
    server. In this case, the field is left empty and disabled, indicating no
    extra header information is transmitted with the request.


    - "body": Defines the data to be sent to the server. The 'mode' signifies
    how the information is sent, 'raw' means the information is sent
    unformatted. However, in this case, the 'raw' data is empty, indicating this
    GET request does not send any data in the body since it's only retrieving
    comments.
