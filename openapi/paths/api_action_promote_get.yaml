    ### Description of Each Data:


    - **name**: This is the title of the API request. It is clearly labeled as
    "Action - Promote - Get," indicating that this request is related to
    promoting an action.


    - **request**: This object encapsulates all the details required to make the
    API call.

      - **auth**: This section specifies the authentication method required for the API request. Here, it is set to bearer token authentication.

        - **type**: Indicates the type of authentication used, which is "bearer" in this instance.

        - **bearer**: An array containing objects for bearer token configuration.

          - **key**: Represents the identifier for the bearer token, which is named "token."

          - **value**: This is where the actual bearer token is provided, represented as "BearerToken." This will typically be replaced with an actual token when making a request.

          - **type**: Specifies the data type of the value, which is set to "string."

      - **method**: This signifies the HTTP method to be used for the request. In this case, it is a "GET" request, meaning the API will retrieve data.

      - **url**: This is the endpoint URL where the API request will be sent. It specifies the base URL (`http://localhost:3000/api/action/promote/get/`) and includes query parameters for `promoteId`, `sessionId`, and `accountId`, which are placeholders that need to be filled in with actual values when making the request.

        - **promoteId**: A query parameter representing the ID of the promotion to be fetched.

        - **sessionId**: A query parameter representing the session ID associated with the promotion request.

        - **accountId**: A query parameter for the account ID related to the request.

      - **headers**: This array is for any additional HTTP headers that may be needed for the request.

        - **key**: The name of the header. In this case, it is empty.

        - **value**: The value of the header, which is also empty here.

        - **type**: The type of the header, set to "default."

        - **disabled**: A boolean that indicates whether this header is currently active or not. Here, it is `true`, meaning this header will not be sent with the request.

      - **body**: This section specifies the body of the request.

        - **mode**: This indicates the format of the request body. It is set to "raw," which means that the body will contain raw data.

        - **raw**: The actual content of the request body in raw format. Currently, this is empty since GET requests typically do not have a body.
