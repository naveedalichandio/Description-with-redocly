  description: >-
    This endpoint corresponds to the deletion of a message in a connection. The
    details for each data are as follows:


    1. `"name"`: This is the name of the endpoint. In this case, it is named
    "Connect - Message - Delete", meaning it's used to delete a message within a
    connection.


    2. `"request"`: This object contains the details of the request to be sent
    to the server.


    3. `"auth"`: This object houses the type and details of the authorization
    required for this endpoint. This uses bearer token authentication. The
    bearer token is typically generated by the server and must be sent with
    every request. 

       `"key"`: This is the key for the bearer token, which is 'token' in this case.
       
       `"value"`: This contains the placeholder value for the bearer token, 'sessionId'.
       
       `"type"`: This signifies the type of data for the bearer token, which in this case is a string.

    4. `"method"`: This is the HTTP method used for the request. Here it's
    'POST', which is typically used for sending data to create/update a
    resource.


    5. `"url"`: This is the URL where the HTTP request will be sent. Here it is
    'http://localhost:3000/api/connect/message/delete'.


    6. `"headers"`: This array represents any custom HTTP headers to be sent
    with the request. Currently it's empty and disabled. 


    7. `"body"`: This object contains information that will be sent to the
    server. In this endpoint, it's sending raw JSON data.

       `"mode"`: This refers to the format of the data being sent. In this case, it's 'raw' - the data will be sent exactly as it is.

       `"raw"`: The raw field contains the raw data to be sent in the request. It's a JSON string with `sessionId`, `accountId` and `messageId`. Every field in the JSON string signifies -
       - `sessionId`: The ID of the current session.
       - `accountId`: The ID of the account from which the message is to be deleted.
       - `messageId`: The ID of the message to be deleted.

    Each of these data points are integral in making an appropriate call to this
    endpoint.
