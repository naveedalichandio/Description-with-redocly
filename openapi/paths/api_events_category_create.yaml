  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Events - Category - Create" and is utilized to
    create a category within an events context.


    The request is made via the "POST" method to the URL
    "http://localhost:3000/api/events/category/create".


    A bearer token is required for authentication, denoted by the "auth" field.
    It requires a "token" key whose value should be your unique BearerToken.
    This value will be expected as a string type.


    The headers are set to default and have no defined keys or values. The
    disabled field set to true means the default headers are not functional
    unless defined.


    The "body" of the request should be in raw mode with a raw JSON data
    containing the following key-value pairs:


    1. "sessionId": This is a required string that stands for the unique session
    ID.

    2. "accountId": This represents the unique account ID involved in the
    creation of the event and is also a required string.

    3. "name": This refers to the technical name of the event category you wish
    to create. It is expected in string format.

    4. "displayName": This represents the show name for the event category. This
    name can be user-friendly and more descriptive. The value should be a
    string.

    5. "description": A brief text providing information about the event
    category. This should be a concise summary of what the category is about.
    This field accepts a string type value.

    6. "tags": This is to include any labels or keywords related to the event
    category. These tags make the event more searchable and should be sent as a
    comma-separated string.


    The option for the body mode is set to 'raw' and language is expected to be
    in 'json' format which implies that the body values need to be in valid JSON
    syntax.
