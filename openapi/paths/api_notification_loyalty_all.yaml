  summary: Notification - Loyalty - Get All
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Notification - Loyalty - Get All", which suggests it
    is likely used to retrieve all loyalty notifications.


    In the `request` key, several details about the nature of this API call are
    specified:


    - `auth`: Specifies the type of authentication used. Here, `Bearer`
    authentication is being used, and the bearer token should be placed in the
    value of the `token` key. 


    - `method`: Specifies the HTTP method used, in this case, `GET`, meaning the
    API call will retrieve data from the server.


    - `url`: Specifies the URL the request will be sent to. In this case, it
    looks like the URL is calling an API locally and is intended to fetch all
    loyalty notifications. There are two query parameters, `sessionId` and
    `accountId`, which likely need to be populated with a valid session ID and
    account ID respectively when calling this API. 


    - `headers`: Contains information that the client (user's browser, for
    instance) sends to the server. In this case, it appears that headers are not
    necessarily required to call the given endpoint as the key and value are
    empty and the header is disabled.


    - `body`: Contains information sent to the server if data needs to be sent
    along with the `GET` request. For this particular request, no raw data is
    being sent in the body. The `mode` is set as `raw`, but the `raw` value is
    an empty string. However, in cases when data needs to be sent, it would
    likely contain further parameters or JSON objects. 


    Please ensure to replace `BearerToken`, `sessionId` and `accountId` with the
    actual valid data before sending the request.
