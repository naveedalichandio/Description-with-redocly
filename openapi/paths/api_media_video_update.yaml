  summary: Media - Video - Update - For Reward
  description: >
    This endpoint, named "Media - Video - Update - For Reward", is used to
    update a specific video related to a reward. It's a PUT request, which
    suggests it's used to update existing information. This API will need to be
    called using Bearer Token Authentication, hence, a token value will be
    supplied in the form of 'BearerToken' under the type of bearer
    authentication.


    There are certain metadata passed as headers, specifically 'Client-UUID'
    which will be the unique identifier for the client invoking the request.


    The body of the request includes several key-value pairs:


    1. 'sessionId': The unique identifier of the session.

    2. 'accountId': The unique identifier of the user's account.

    3. 'rewardId': The unique identifier of the reward for which the video is
    being updated.

    4. 'videoId': The unique identifier of the video which is being updated.

    5. 'name': The new name that you want to assign to the video.

    6. 'description': A brief detail about the video.

    7. 'tags': Keywords related to the video which will be updated separated by
    commas.

    8. 'contentType': The specific filetype of the content being uploaded, in
    this case 'application/webm'.

    9. 'contentLength': The size of the video file. Although it's set to zero
    now, it's expected to be filled with the actual size of the file.

    10. 'targetKey': Presumably the key where the URL of the video will be
    stored, in this case 'profilePhotoUrl'.

    11. 'compressUsing': The method used for compression, in this case 'Base64'.

    12. 'isCompressed': A flag indicating whether the video is compressed or
    not. Here, it's true indicating the video is compressed.

    13. 'isPrivate': A flag indicating the privacy status of the media, where
    false indicates that it is public.

    14. 'data': The content of the video as a string, shown here as '...'.


    Note: The JSON data for the request is sent as raw data, indicated by the
    "mode" key in the body of the request. The language of the raw data is JSON,
    indicated by "language" key under "options" on "raw".
