    ### Endpoint Description: Search - Results - Get Tournaments - By Team Name


    **Endpoint Name**: This endpoint is used to search for tournaments by a
    specific team name.


    **Request Type**: 

    - **Method**: `GET` 
      - This indicates that the request will retrieve data from the server and will not modify any resources.

    **Authorization**:

    - **Auth Type**: `Bearer`
      - This type of authentication requires a bearer token to be included in the request for access to the endpoint.
      - **Token Structure**:
        - **Key**: "token" 
          - This is the name of the header that carries the authorization token.
        - **Value**: "BearerToken" 
          - This placeholder represents the actual bearer token needed for authentication. Users should replace this with their valid token.
        - **Type**: "string" 
          - This indicates that the token value is a string.

    **URL**: 

    -
    `http://localhost:3000/api/search/results/all/?team=NikeShoes&find=tournaments`
      - This is the request URL used to access the endpoint. 
      - Query parameters explained:
        - **team=NikeShoes**: This parameter specifies the name of the team whose tournaments are being searched. In this case, the team name is "NikeShoes".
        - **find=tournaments**: This parameter indicates that the search is specifically looking for tournaments associated with the specified team.

    **Headers**: 

    - The header section currently shows an empty key and value pair and is
    marked as disabled.
      - This means no additional headers are being sent with the request. Users can add custom headers if needed.

    **Body**:

    - **Mode**: `raw`
      - Indicates that the body of the request doesnâ€™t contain any data since it's a GET request.
    - **Raw**: 
      - The raw data section is empty, which is expected for a GET request as the parameters needed are included in the URL.
