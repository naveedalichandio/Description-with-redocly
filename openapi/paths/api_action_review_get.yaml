    ### Endpoint Description: Action - Review - Get


    - **Name**: This endpoint is referred to as "Action - Review - Get". It is
    designed to retrieve a review based on specific parameters.


    - **Method**: The HTTP method used for this request is **GET**, indicating
    that the endpoint is meant to fetch data without modifying any server
    resources.


    - **URL**: The request is sent to the following URL:
      ```
      http://localhost:3000/api/action/review/get/?reviewId=reviewId&sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId
      ```
      This URL includes query parameters for `reviewId`, `sessionId`, and `accountId`, which are essential for identifying which review to retrieve.

    - **Query Parameters**:
      - **reviewId**: This parameter should be replaced with the actual ID of the review you want to fetch. It serves as a unique identifier for the review.
      - **sessionId**: This parameter represents the session context under which the review was created or accessed. It helps in tracking user sessions.
      - **accountId**: This parameter indicates the account associated with the review, allowing for filtering based on user accounts.

    - **Authentication**: The request requires bearer token authentication. This
    means that access to this endpoint is secured and needs a valid token to be
    provided in the request header.
      - **Bearer Token**: 
        - **Key**: `token`
        - **Value**: `BearerToken` - This is a placeholder for the actual token that will authorize the request.
        - **Type**: This is marked as a string, indicating the format of the token.

    - **Headers**: The current state of headers shows one placeholder with no
    key or value and is disabled. This means no additional headers are currently
    required or sent with this request aside from the authorization token.


    - **Body**: The request body is set to raw mode but contains no data. For a
    GET request, it is typical to not include a body, so this configuration is
    appropriate.


    Overall, this endpoint allows users to retrieve specific review details by
    providing necessary identifiers in the URL, ensuring that access is
    controlled through bearer token authentication.
