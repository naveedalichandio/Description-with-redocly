  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Recurring - Zelle - Delete". It is designed to
    delete a recurring Zelle payment in the database. It is a 'POST' request
    which sends data to the specified URL.


    The URL for this particular request is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/payment/recurring/delete". Essentially, it
    implies that we are working with a payment API on a local server and
    specifically dealing with recurring payments deletion.


    The request doesn't include any headers. Headers in API requests define the
    operating parameters of an HTTP transaction.


    Thereafter, we have the body of the request. This is where the details about
    the recurring payment that should be deleted are defined:


    - 'Mode' indicates the data formatted expected by the endpoint. For this
    endpoint, the data should come in 'raw', unprocessed form.


    - 'Raw' holds the payload data being sent to the API. In this case, it has
    four fields in JSON format:

      - 'accountId': This is assumed to be the unique identifier of the account from which the recurring payment is set up.
      
      - 'sessionId': This is likely a unique identifier for the session in which the delete request is made. It could be used for maintaining session state and tracking.

      - 'recurringId': This is most likely the unique identifier for the recurring payment that is to be deleted.

      - 'provider': As the name suggests, this field specifies who is the service provider of the payment system. It is set to 'Zelle' for this request.
      
    - 'Options: Raw:Language' indicates the language used to display the raw
    payload data mentioned above, which is JSON in this case.


    Please ensure to replace the 'accountId', 'sessionId', and 'recurringId'
    with actual values while making a request to the API.


    This endpoint needs adequate permissions for handling delete operations for
    recurring payments.
