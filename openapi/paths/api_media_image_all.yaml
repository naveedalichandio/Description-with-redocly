  description: >-
    This API is named "Media - Image - Get All". It is a GET request intended to
    retrieve all images from the media section of this application. Below are
    the details regarding each part of the request.


    - **Auth**: This request uses bearer token authentication. In order to
    authenticate yourself, you need to provide a string value called
    "BearerToken".


    - **Method**: This is a GET request. This kind of request is generally used
    to retrieve resources from a server. 


    - **URL**: The endpoint where the request is made is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/media/image/all`. Two query parameters should be
    attached to the URL â€“ `sessionId` & `accountId`. The values of these query
    parameters should be replaced with actual session ID and account ID for the
    user's session respectively.


    - **Headers**: There is a placeholder for a header field in the request but
    it is currently disabled and doesn't contain any value or key, means it
    isn't used.


    - **Body**: The body mode is set to "raw" but there is currently no content
    in the body of the request. Generally, for GET requests, the body is left
    empty as we are not sending any data to the server, we just retrieve it.


    Remember to replace "BearerToken", "sessionId", and "accountId" with actual
    values when testing or using this endpoint in an application context.
