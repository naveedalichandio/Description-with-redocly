  description: >-
    This endpoint, named "Chat - Comment - Create", is used to create a new
    comment in a chat. It is a HTTP POST request to the URL
    http://localhost:3000/api/chat/comment/create. Here is a deeper look at the
    different pieces of data provided in this endpoint:


    1. **auth**: This contains the authorization method which is of type
    "bearer". The bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an
    HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer
    tokens. 

       **key**: The key field contains the name of the header, which is "token".

       **value**: The value field contains the actual Bearer token that needs to be added in the header for access.

       **type**: This defines the data type of the value, in this case, it is a string.

    2. **method**: The HTTP method used for this request is POST. HTTP POST
    requests are used to send data to the server, like when you fill out a form
    and hit 'submit'. In this case, it is used to create a new chat comment.


    3. **url**: This is the endpoint where the POST request is to be sent. 


    4. **headers**: This is currently empty but would typically contain any
    extra headers that need to be added to the request.


    5. **body**: This is the data that is sent with the POST request. The data
    is in raw format and the mode type is "raw" under the body field.

       **raw**: This is the actual data being sent in the request. It contains:
       
      - `commentText`: The text of the comment that is being created.
      
      - `threadId`: The unique identifier for the thread where the comment is being posted.
      
      - `replyToId`: The id of the comment this new comment is responding to, in case the new comment is a reply.
      
      - `accountId`: The id of the account creating the comment.
      
      - `sessionId`: The id of the current session.

       **options**: In the options field, raw is defined with language as json. It means that the raw data is written in JSON format.

    Remember to replace "BearerToken", "threadId", "replyToId", "accountId", and
    "sessionId" with actual values when using this endpoint.
