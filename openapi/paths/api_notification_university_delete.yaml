    Token Authentication. 

       - "bearer": An array that holds the token information. 
       - "key" field with the value "token" suggests that the client must send a 'token' field as part of the authentication. 
       - "value" field with the value "sessionId" implies that the value for 'token' should be the session Id. 
       - "type" denotes the data type of the "token" which is in this case, a string.

    indicates that this API sends data to the server to create a resource.

    specifically directed to the "notification/university/delete" path of the
    local server running on port 3000.


    6. "headers": This is an array to specify any custom HTTP headers for the
    request. Currently, it contains a disabled default key-value pair, which
    implies no additional headers are required for this request.


    7. "body": The body of the request contains the actual data that needs to be
    sent to the server.

       - "mode": This field defines how the body data should be treated. Its value "raw" explains that the body data will be taken as it is, without further transformation.
