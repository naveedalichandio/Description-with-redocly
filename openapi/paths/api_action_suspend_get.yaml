    ### Action - Suspend - Get


    This API endpoint is designed to retrieve information related to a specific
    suspend action. Below is a detailed description of each component involved
    in the request.


    #### Request Information:


    - **Auth**: 
      - **Type**: Specifies that the authentication method used is Bearer Token.
      - **Bearer**: 
        - **Key**: This denotes the authorization key used in the request.
        - **Value**: This is where you will insert the actual token required for authorization. Replace "BearerToken" with your valid token.
        - **Type**: Indicates the data type of the token as a string.

    - **Method**: 
      - The HTTP method used for this request is `GET`. This implies that the request is intended to retrieve data from the server.

    - **URL**: 
      - This is the endpoint where the request is sent. The URL is structured as follows:
        - **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/action/suspend/get/`
        - **Query Parameters**:
          - **suspendId**: Replace `suspendId` with the unique identifier for the suspend action you want to query.
          - **sessionId**: Replace `sessionId` with the identifier for the session related to this action.
          - **accountId**: Replace `accountId` with the identifier for the account you wish to retrieve information for.

    - **Headers**: 
      - This section can include additional HTTP headers required for the request. Currently, it is empty and disabled.

    - **Body**:
      - The body of the request is set to `raw` mode and is blank. For a `GET` request, traditionally, you do not send a body, so this section does not require any data. 

    Make sure to update the placeholders in the URL with actual values before
    executing the request to ensure it works correctly.
