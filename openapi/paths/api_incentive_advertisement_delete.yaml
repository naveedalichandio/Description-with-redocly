    1. `"name"`: This is the name of your API endpoint. In this case, the `name`
    is "Incentive - Advertisement - Delete". This implies that this endpoint is
    used to delete an incentive advertisement.


    2. `"request"`: This outlines the details of the request made to the
    endpoint. It includes the authentication used, the request method, the url
    where the request should go to, headers if any, and the body of the request.


    3. `"auth"`: This describes the type of authentication used for this
    endpoint. In this case, it uses `bearer` authentication. When making a
    request to this endpoint, you must supply a "token" in the request headers.
    The `value` given here, "sessionId", suggests that you would replace this
    placeholder with the actual session ID for authentication.


    4. `"method"`: This is the HTTP Request method used for the endpoint. In
    this case, it is `POST`, meaning this endpoint is used for sending data to
    be processed to a resource on the server.


    5. `"url"`: This is the URL of the endpoint. It specifies where the request
    is sent when the endpoint is called. 


    6. `"headers"`: These are additional settings included with the HTTP
    request. Here, no specific key-value header pairs are given, and the only
    listed header is disabled, meaning it won't be sent with the request.


    7. `"body"`: This contains the data that you want to send to the route. It
    is in `raw` format, and for this endpoint, it contains a sessionId,
    accountId, and advertisementId. These would usually be replaced with actual
    values when making a request.

       - `"sessionId"`: The session ID which is likely used as a part of bearer 
         authentication.
       - `"accountId"`: Identifier for the specific account related to the request.
       - `"advertisementId"`: Identifier for the specific advertisement the request is focused on.

    Remember to replace "sessionId", "accountId" and "advertisementId" in the
    request body with actual values when using this endpoint.
