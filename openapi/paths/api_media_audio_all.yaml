  summary: Media - Audio - Get All
  description: >-
    This endpoint is called "Media - Audio - Get All" and it falls under the GET
    method. This endpoint's purpose is to fetch all data related to an audio
    media in the database by querying with specific parameters.


    The main elements of this endpoint are:


    - **Name**: This signifies the name of the API endpoint which in this
    context is "Media - Audio - Get All". It's used for pulling all audio media
    data.


    - **Request**: This object contains the details for the server request.


    - **Auth**: Authorization details are contained within this object and it
    has several components:
        - **Type**: The type of authentication used, which is 'bearer' in this case.
        - **Bearer**: It contains an object that has the authentication token, `BearerToken` and its type which is string.

    - **Method**: This attribute specifies the HTTP request method to be used
    when making the request to the endpoint, in this case, it's `GET`.


    - **URL**: This is the address to which the HTTP request is being sent. It
    features query parameters that can be dynamically set and used for unique
    identification while returning the data. The URL here is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/media/audio/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId`.
    This endpoint should return all audio files for the provided `sessionId` and
    `accountId`.


    - **Headers**: They are used to send additional information along with the
    request. No specific `key-value` pair has been provided here. They are
    disabled in this case.


    - **Body**: This attributes hold any extra data that needs to be sent to the
    server. In this case, it is empty (`raw: ""`) because GET request doesnâ€™t
    use the body to send data to the server.


    Remember to replace `"BearerToken"`, `"sessionId"` and `"accountId"` with
    actual values while testing or running this endpoint.
