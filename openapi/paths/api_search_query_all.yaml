    1. "name": This data field signifies the name of the endpoint. It is called
    "Search - Query - Get All By User". This is essentially an identifier that
    tells you the purpose of the endpoint. 


    2. "request": Contains all the information required to make an HTTP request.
    This includes authentication, method, URL, headers, and body.


    3. "auth": Represents the authentication method to access the endpoint. This
    is of type "bearer", which means that the authorization requires a bearer
    token to be sent in the request.


    4. "bearer": This is an array containing the bearer token that will be used
    for authentication in the request. The "key" field is named "token",
    indicating the kind of token used for authentication. The "value" field is
    the token itself, usually generated from the server. The "type" field
    indicates the data type of the "value", which is "string".


    5. "method": Represents the HTTP method used for the request. In this case,
    it is a "GET" request, which is used to retrieve information from the
    server.


    6. "url": This is the URL or the path of the server where the request is
    being made. In this case, it's a local server
    http://localhost:3000/api/search/query/all?. Followed by the URL, there are
    two query parameters "accountId" and "sessionId" which are used to filter
    the results.


    7. "headers": This is an array that contains the information that the client
    (or your browser) sends in an HTTP request to the server. It may include any
    extra information you want to send to the server. In this case, no key-value
    pairs are provided and it is disabled.


    8. "body": Contains the body of the request. For a GET method, this will
    typically be empty as shown here. The "mode" indicates how the body data
    will be sent to the server. In this case, "raw" means the data is sent as it
    is without any encoding or extra processing. There is no raw data provided
    in this case.
