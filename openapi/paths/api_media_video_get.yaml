  description: >-
    This endpoint is named as "Media - Video - Get - For Public". It refers to a
    functionality which retrieves media, specifically videos for public
    viewing. 


    1. Auth: This is the authorization part of the endpoint. It uses bearer
    token type authorization.
       - Key: It identifies the name of the token, which is "token" here.
       - Value: It is the actual token value, here represented as 'BearerToken'. 
       - Type: This tells us what type of data the bearer token is. The type here is string.

    2. Request Method: The HTTP method used for this endpoint is 'GET'. This
    method is primarily designed to retrieve data from the server.


    3. URL:
    "http://localhost:3000/api/media/video/get/?videoId=videoId&public=1". This
    is the URL that will be hit when sending the endpoint request. It contains
    two parameters:
       - videoId: This parameter is to provide the unique identifier of the video you want to retrieve.
       - public: This parameter determines if the video is meant for public viewing. The value of 1 implies it is for the public.

    4. Headers: The header fields are not currently used in this endpoint
    request. It contains an empty key and value. The 'disabled' attribute set to
    true indicates that this header field may have future uses but is currently
    not being used.


    5. Body: Here the mode is set as 'raw' which means it can send data without
    any processing. But currently, no data is to be sent in the body, hence it
    is empty.
