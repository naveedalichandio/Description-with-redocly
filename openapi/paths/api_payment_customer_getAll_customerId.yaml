  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Customer - Zelle - Get All". It uses the GET HTTP
    method to retrieve all the Zelle payment customers.


    Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the components:


    1. "name": It's the title of the endpoint. In this case, "Customer - Zelle -
    Get All" indicates that the endpoint is meant to retrieve all Zelle
    customers.


    2. "method": This represents the HTTP method used. "GET" method retrieves
    information from the specified source.


    3. "url": This contains the URL where the request will be sent.
    "http://localhost:3000/api/payment/customer/getAll/customerId" is the
    address of the endpoint.

       The URL has several parameters attached to it which include:

       - "provider": This parameter specifies the payment provider. Here, it's set to 'zelle'.

       - "accountId": This parameter signifies the unique id for a customer's account. The actual accountId should be substituted in place of 'accountId'.

       - "sessionId": This parameter is used to track sessions. The actual sessionId should be replaced in the place of 'sessionId'.

    4. "headers": At the moment, the "headers" array is empty. It usually
    contains any required additional information to process the request
    correctly, or metadata about the incoming request, such as the host, user
    agent, etc. It's empty in this case, which means no extra information is
    required for this API call.
