    ### Endpoint Overview: University - Video - Delete


    #### Description:

    This endpoint allows users to delete a video associated with a university
    account. The request requires authentication and must be sent to the
    appropriate URL.


    #### Request Details:


    - **Authentication**: 
      - The request requires a bearer token for authentication. This token should be passed in the authorization header. 
      - The bearer token is provided in the following format:
        - **Key**: `token`
        - **Value**: Represents the `sessionId`, which is used to verify the user's session.

    - **HTTP Method**: 
      - The request uses the `POST` method to submit the video deletion request.

    - **URL**: 
      - The endpoint URL for the delete request is `http://localhost:3000/api/university/video/delete`. This is the target where the delete operation is performed.

    - **Headers**:
      - Currently, there are no additional headers defined for the request. One of the headers is present but disabled and does not have a key or value assigned. This can be removed or updated as needed.

    - **Body**: 
      - The body of the request is sent in `raw` JSON format and contains the following key-value pairs:
        - **sessionId**: This key holds the session identifier for the current user session which is necessary for validating the request.
        - **accountId**: This key represents the unique identifier for the university account under which the video resides. 
        - **videoId**: This key is the identifier of the video that needs to be deleted. It specifies which video will be removed from the account.

    Make sure to replace the placeholders (`sessionId`, `accountId`, and
    `videoId`) with actual values before sending the request.
