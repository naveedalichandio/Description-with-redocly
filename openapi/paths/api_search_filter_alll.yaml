  description: >-
    The endpoint described here bears the name "Search - Filter - Get All By
    User". This name suggests that the endpoint is responsible for retrieving
    all filter items related to a specific user based on a search operation.
    Here's a detailed breakdown of each data component:


    1. "request": This is the main body of the request for this endpoint.


    2. "auth": This refers to the authentication method used for this request.
    In this instance, a "bearer" type authentication is utilized.

       - "bearer": This is an authentication method that involves sending a bearer token. In this case, the token's key is simply "token", and the value is "BearerToken". The token type is a string.

    3. "method": This is the HTTP method used for the API call. For this
    endpoint, a "GET" method is used, indicating that it retrieves particular
    resources.


    4. "url": This is the URL of the API that the call is sent to. The endpoint
    can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/api/search/filter/all/` with two
    query parameters, `accountId` and `sessionId`.


    5. "headers": This section is used to send additional information about the
    API request. In this case, the key and value fields are empty and disabled,
    meaning no additional header details are required for the API call.


    6. "body": This section represents the data that is sent with the API
    request. The mode is set to "raw" but no data is meant to be sent with this
    request hence the "raw" field is empty. This suggests that this API endpoint
    only needs the information available in the URL to complete its operation.
