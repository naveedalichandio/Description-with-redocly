    This endpoint is labeled as "Article - Category - Create" and is designated
    for creating a new category within an article domain. It uses the POST
    method and makes a request to
    "http://localhost:3000/api/article/category/create". The endpoint uses
    Bearer token type for authorization. You need to replace the "BearerToken"
    with your actual bearer token to get authenticated.


    In this request, the following key-value pairs are sent:


    1. `sessionId`: Represents the session ID of the active user. Replace
    "sessionId" with the actual ID of the user session.


    2. `accountId`: Represents the account ID of the user. Replace "accountId"
    with the actual ID of the user account.


    3. `name`: The unique, short, and URL-friendly name of the category. For
    example, "Miami Art Week 4".


    4. `displayName`: The full user-friendly name of the category to display in
    the UI, for instance, "Miami Art Week 2024".


    5. `description`: A brief explanation about the category. For example, "An
    immersive celebration of art and culture during Miami Art Week."


    6. `tags`: A list of keywords associated with the category, separated by
    commas. For example, "Art,Exhibition,Miami,Culture".


    Note: The entire body parameters are in raw JSON format. The format of the
    JSON data should be as highlighted in the `body.raw` key.


    The endpoint currently contains no custom headers, as indicated by the empty
    "key" and "value" fields in `headers`. However, the `type` is set to
    "default", and the `disabled` field is set to `true`, indicating these
    headers are not currently in use.
