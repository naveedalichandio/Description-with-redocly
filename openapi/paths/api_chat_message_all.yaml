  summary: Chat - Message - Get All With Deleted
  description: >-
    This API endpoint is named `Chat - Message - Get All With Deleted`. It is
    designed for retrieving all chat messages in a given thread, including those
    messages that have been deleted.


    1. `Auth`: This section describes the type of authorization used by this
    endpoint i.e., Bearer Authentication. This type of authorization validates
    requests based on the bearer token included in the header. A bearer token
    must be provided, the key should be `token`, and the value must be the
    assigned `BearerToken` for the current session.


    2. `Method`: The HTTP method used for this request is `GET`. This method is
    typically used for retrieving data from a server.


    3. `URL`: The URL where the endpoint is available is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/chat/message/all`. Note that some query
    parameters are required in the URL:

        - `threadId`: This parameter is expected to be replaced with the real ID of the thread of interest.
      
        - `accountId`: This represents the ID of an account or user. You need to replace this with the actual account ID.
      
        - `sessionId`: This represents the ID of a chat session. You must replace this with the valid session ID.
      
        - `deleted`: This query parameter is a flag which specifies whether to include deleted messages in the response or not. If it's set to `1`, deleted messages will be included.

    4. `Headers`: This field is currently empty, which means that there are no
    additional headers required for this request. In case of changes, new
    headers such as `Content-Type` or `Accept` may be needed in future.
