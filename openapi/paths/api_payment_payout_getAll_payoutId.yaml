    This endpoint
    `http://localhost:3000/api/payment/payout/getAll/payoutId?provider=zelle&accountId=accountId&sessionId=sessionId`
    provides the function "Payout - Zelle - Get All". 


    1. **name**: This field identifies the name of the backend function that the
    endpoint connects to. In this case, "Payout - Zelle - Get All" signifies
    that it is a function meant to fetch all the payout details related to the
    Zelle platform.


    2. **request**: This object provides information about the HTTP request that
    will be made to the endpoint.


    3. **method**: This field indicates the HTTP method used for the request. In
    this case, the "GET" method shows that the function is retrieving data from
    the server.


    4. **url**: This field provides the URL/location to which the request is
    sent. It consists of the base URL (`http://localhost:3000`), the endpoint
    path (`/api/payment/payout/getAll/payoutId`), and query parameters
    (`provider=zelle&accountId=accountId&sessionId=sessionId`). 


    - "provider=zelle" indicates that the payments provider is Zelle. 

    - "accountId=accountId" instructs the function to pull data related to a
    specific account, determined by replacing "accountId" in the URL with the
    actual account ID.

    - "sessionId=sessionId" is a unique identifier to validate the session from
    which the request was made, necessary for security purposes. 


    5. **headers**: This field is an array, that contains metadata in the form
    of key-value pairs to be sent as part of the HTTP request. In this case, no
    custom headers are included with the request. Additional header information
    might be needed based on the server configuration. 


    Please make sure to replace "accountId" and "sessionId" with the actual
    account and session IDs when using this endpoint.
