  summary: Notification - Tokens - Get All
  description: >-
    The provided endpoint fetches all notification tokens. Here's a detailed
    description of each data point:


    1. `"name"`: This specifies the name of the API endpoint. In this case,
    "Notification - Tokens - Get All" indicates that this endpoint will retrieve
    all notification tokens.


    2. `"request"`: Request block holds the information about the type of the
    request to be sent.


    3. `"auth"`: This is used for authentication. This API uses bearer
    authentication which is specified in the `"type"` field as `"bearer"`. 


    4. `"bearer"`: This is an array that stores the list of bearer tokens
    required for authentication.
      
        - `"key"`: Specifies the key related to the bearer token which is `"token"`.
      
        - `"value"`: Here, `"BearerToken"` is placeholder for the actual bearer token to be used in request.
      
        - `"type"`: This field specifies the data type of the `"value"` field which is of the `"string"` data type.
      
    5. `"method"`: This parameter indicates the HTTP method to be used for the
    request. In this case, `"GET"` method will be used for the request.


    6. `"url"`: Specifies the URL to which the request will be sent. It includes
    the base URL, route, and query parameters. 

       - `"http://localhost:3000/api/notification/tokens/all/"` is the base URL with specific route.

       - `?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId` are query parameters which include `sessionId` and `accountId` you need to add in the request.

    7. `"headers"`: This is an array that would usually contain any additional
    headers required for the request. No headers are sent in this request as the
    only array object is disabled, that's why `"key"` and `"value"` fields are
    empty.


    8. `"body"`: Contains necessary information required for processing the
    request.

       - `"mode"`: The mode of the request body, in this case, it's `"raw"`, which means raw data can be written directly in the body.

       - `"raw"`: This is the actual data to be sent along with the request. `"raw"` data is empty for this request because it's a GET request; GET requests do not typically use the request body to send data to the server.
