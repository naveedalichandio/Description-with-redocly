  summary: Account - Send - Verification SMS
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named `Account - Send - Verification SMS`. It uses the
    `POST` method to send a verification SMS to a user's phone.


    - `auth`: The endpoint uses `bearer` authentication, which means you need to
    provide a bearer token in the request header. The key for this token is
    `token` and its initial value is `BearerToken`. The token's data type is
    `string`. You will likely replace `BearerToken` with an actual token value
    when you run this endpoint.


    - `method`: This is a `POST` endpoint. That means it is designed to accept
    and process the submitted data.


    - `url`: The endpoint's URL is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/account/send/verificationSMS`. You can replace
    `localhost:3000` with any server's address where this API is running.


    - `headers`: By default, this API does not require any additional request
    headers. The header object is set to `disabled` and both the `key` and
    `value` properties are empty strings. You can add headers if required for
    your application.


    - `body`: The body of the request should be a 'raw' JSON object that
    includes the phone number where the verification SMS will be sent. The
    `phone` field should contain the phone number.


    Remember to replace the `BearerToken` with an actual bearer token and the
    `phone` field value with an actual phone number when you run this endpoint.
