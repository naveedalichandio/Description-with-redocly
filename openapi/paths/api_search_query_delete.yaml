  summary: Search - Query - Delete
  description: >-
    This endpoint description carries the name "Search - Query - Delete", which
    points to its basic purpose, that is to perform deletion operations on
    search queries.


    - `auth`: This field holds the authentication details needed for the
    endpoint. This endpoint uses `bearer token` authentication. There is a
    key-value pair within an array. The `key` is designated as `token` while the
    `value` is the `sessionId`. Every session must provide this `sessionId` as a
    string value in order to initiate authenticated requests.


    - `method`: The HTTP method utilized by this endpoint is `POST`. This means
    the endpoint is designed to send or append data to be processed on the
    server side.


    - `url`: This field contains the URL where the request is being sent. The
    endpoint communicates with `http://localhost:3000/api/search/query/delete`,
    indicating that it is used for deleting search queries on your local
    development environment.


    - `headers`: In this case, an array with an empty `key`-`value` pair and
    `type` set to the `default` is specified, but its use is currently disabled
    as indicated by the `disabled` Boolean value.


    - `body`: This contains the data that's being sent with the request. The
    `mode` used for the body of this POST request is `raw`, which means the data
    in the body isn't in key/value format. Rather, it's in a JSON string format.
    In the `raw` field, an object is being passed with key-value pairs of
    `sessionId`, `accountId`, and `queryId`. These are necessary parameters for
    deleting a search query, suggesting that you can't delete a query without
    having the `sessionId`, `accountId`, and `queryId`.
