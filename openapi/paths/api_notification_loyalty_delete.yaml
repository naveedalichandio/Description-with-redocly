  summary: Notification - Loyalty - Delete
  description: >-
    This endpoint, named "Notification - Loyalty - Delete", is designed to
    receive a POST request in order to delete a specific loyalty notification.
    Here are the details:


    - **name**: This is simply the name of the endpoint which is "Notification -
    Loyalty - Delete".


    - **auth**: It houses information for authentication. It's a bearer type,
    which means the authorization is based on a bearer token. It holds a
    key-value pair, where the key is `token` and the value is a `sessionId`.


    - **request**: This corresponds to the HTTP request. It contains the
    authentication, method, url, headers, and body data.


    - **method**: It is a `POST` method. This means data will be sent to a
    server to create a certain resource.


    - **url**: This is the URL where the API request will be sent. In this case,
    the URL is
    [http://localhost:3000/api/notification/loyalty/delete](http://localhost:3000/api/notification/loyalty/delete).


    - **headers**: Holds the headers that are sent alongside the request.
    Currently, no headers are sent and any existing ones are disabled, hence the
    empty value and the `disabled` set to `true`.


    - **body**: This has the actual data/content you'll send with your API
    request. The mode is set to `raw`, which means you can enter the data as it
    is, without any additional encoding.


    - **raw**: Contains the raw JSON data that is to be sent in the request
    body. It contains three strings: `sessionId`, `accountId`, and `loyaltyId`. 

      - `sessionId`: This should be replaced with the actual session ID.
      - `accountId`: Should be replaced with the target account ID of the loyalty scheme.
      - `loyaltyId`: The identifier for the specific loyalty scheme to be deleted.
      
    Please ensure to replace fields with appropriate values when making a
    request.
