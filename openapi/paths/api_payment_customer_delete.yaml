  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Customer - Zelle - Delete". This endpoint pertains
    to the payment service provided in the API, specifically for deleting
    customer information related to Zelle payment. 


    Request Details:


    The request method used is POST, which means it is used to send data to the
    API server in order to perform an action. 


    The URL where the request is sent is
    http://localhost:3000/api/payment/customer/delete. This is the URL to your
    local server running on port 3000 for payment service particularly for the
    deletion of customer information. 


    The 'headers' field is currently empty. If any additional information is
    required by the server to process the request, it would be included in this
    field. 


    Body Details:


    The 'body' field contains the data that is sent to the server. Its 'mode' is
    'raw' which means the data will be sent exactly in the same way as it is
    specified.


    The 'raw' data in the 'body' field includes the following attributes:


    - "accountId": This should contain the account ID of the user. This is a
    required field to identify the user account associated with the Zelle
    payment.
      
    - "sessionId": This would hold the session ID for the current session of the
    user. It is required for the server to maintain the state of the session.


    - "customerId": This field should contain the customer ID. This is a
    required field which helps identify the customer who is using the Zelle
    payment service.


    - "provider": Here, the value is "zelle". As this endpoint is for Zelle
    payments, this field will always contain the same value.


    In the 'options' object under 'body', it specifies that the language used is
    JSON. Here, 'language' is set to 'json', meaning that the server acts upon
    or responds to the data in JSON format.
