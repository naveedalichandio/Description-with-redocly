    **Endpoint Description**


    **Name**: Action - Follow - Get All  

    This endpoint is used to retrieve all follow actions associated with a
    specific session and account.


    **Request Details**:


    1. **Authorization**: 
       - **Type**: Bearer
         - This indicates that the API uses bearer token authentication. 
       - **Bearer Token**: 
         - **Key**: token
         - **Value**: BearerToken
         - **Type**: string
         - The value 'BearerToken' should be replaced with an actual token that authenticates the user making the request. The token grants access to the API.

    2. **Method**: 
       - **GET**: 
         - This HTTP method is used to request data from the server. In this case, it fetches data related to follow actions.

    3. **URL**: 
       - **Endpoint**: http://localhost:3000/api/action/follow/all/
         - This is the base URL that directs the request to the API endpoint responsible for handling follow actions.
       - **Query Parameters**: 
         - **sessionId**: sessionId
           - Replace this with the actual session ID to specify which user's session data to retrieve.
         - **accountId**: accountId
           - Replace this with the actual account ID to identify which account's follow actions you want to fetch.

    4. **Headers**: 
       - An array that could contain custom headers, but in this case, it is currently empty.
       - The provided header configuration is disabled, meaning no additional headers will be sent with this request.

    5. **Body**: 
       - **Mode**: raw
         - This indicates that there is no body content required for this GET request.
       - **Raw**: An empty string, as the GET method typically does not send a body.

    This endpoint will return all follow actions linked to the specified session
    and account, given the correct authentication and parameter values.
