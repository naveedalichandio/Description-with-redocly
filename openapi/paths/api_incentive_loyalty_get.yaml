  description: >-
    This API endpoint is called "Incentive - Loyalty - Get". This uses the HTTP
    'GET' method to retrieve loyalty incentive information.


    #### Authentication

    The authentication required for this endpoint is of the type 'bearer'. This
    requires a valid token to authenticate the requests made to the endpoint.
    This token field key is "token" and should hold the bearer token string.


    #### Method

    The HTTP method used for this endpoint is GET. This HTTP method is used to
    retrieve data from the server.


    #### URL

    The 'url' is where the request is being sent. This is where the server is
    located to handle this specific endpoint. This URL format is
    http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/loyalty/get and it's parameterized with
    loyaltyId, sessionId, accountId. 


    'loyaltyId' - This parameter is used to specify the loyalty program's ID.

    'sessionId' -This parameter is used to maintain the session information.

    'accountId' - This parameter is used to specify the account ID.


    #### Headers

    Headers can be added to amend the request. In the provided data, a header
    template is included, but it is disabled by default. Hence, this field can
    be left empty or can be filled with necessary request header info such as
    content-type, auth-token etc.


    #### Body

    The 'body' carries the bulk of the request information. This endpoint uses
    'raw' mode for the body, but as it is a GET request, it doesn't require a
    body. Therefore, the 'raw' field is left empty. 


    So, primarily you need to authenticate yourself and pass the user
    'loyaltyId', 'sessionId' and 'accountId' as parameters in the request URL to
    get the required information.
