        - **Value**: The value provided here should be a valid bearer token, formatted as "BearerToken".
        - **Type**: Indicates the data type of the key value, which is a string.

    - **Method**: The HTTP method used for the request is "GET". This means the
    endpoint is intended to retrieve data rather than create or modify it.

    consists of a base URL followed by query parameters.

        - **sessionId**: This parameter indicates the session ID for the request. Similar to tagId, it should be replaced with an actual session ID value.
        - **accountId**: This parameter identifies the account associated with the request. It also needs a real account ID value.

    - **Headers**: This section contains headers to be sent with the request. In
    this instance:
      - **Key**: No header key is specified.
      - **Value**: No header value is specified.
      - **Type**: Set to "default", indicating it is a standard header.
      - **Disabled**: This is marked as true, suggesting that this header will not be included in the request.

    specific identifiers, ensuring that the request is authenticated properly.
