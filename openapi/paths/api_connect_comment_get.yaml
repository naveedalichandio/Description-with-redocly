    This endpoint is labeled "Connect - Comment - Get". It provides a
    functionality to retrieve a comment from the connect API. 


    1. "auth": This is the authorization method required for the API. It uses a
    'bearer token' for authorization. A bearer token is a type of access token
    that is sent as a part of the header in API requests to authenticate the
    user making the request. 
        - "type": Is "bearer", indicating the type of authorization method in use.
        - "bearer": This is an array containing bearer token information.
            - "key": Specifies "token" as the key.
            - "value": The value is expected to be the actual "BearerToken" to authenticate the request.
            - "type": Is "string", specifying that the value of the token will be a string.

    2. "method": The method to be used to request the particular endpoint. In
    this case, it is "GET", meaning the request will retrieve information from
    the API.


    3. "url": This is the address where the API is located. Here it is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/connect/comment/get/?commentId=commentId". It
    also includes a parameter "commentId", which allows users to specify the
    comment they want to retrieve information about.


    4. "headers": This field is used to send additional information in the
    request header. In this endpoint, it is set to empty (both key and value)
    and is also disabled.


    5. "body": This section contains any data that needs to be sent with a
    request. Here, the "mode" is set to "raw", indicating that the body content
    should be taken 'as is'. In this endpoint, no body data (raw content) should
    be sent as it's a GET request and so, "raw" is set to an empty string.
