  summary: Charge - Zelle - Create
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Charge - Zelle - Create". It is designed to create a
    payment charge using the Zelle payment method. 


    The request uses the "POST" method, which means it's used to submit data to
    be processed to the identified resource. The URL that the request is sent to
    is 'http://localhost:3000/api/payment/charge/create'. 


    The request body is in raw mode, representing an unparsed sequence of
    characters. The data sent via this method is in JSON format (Javascript
    Object Notation, a human-readable and easy-to-parse data exchange format).


    The data included in the body are as follows:


    - `accountId`: This field is used to specify the unique identifier for the
    account undertaking the transaction. Replace "accountId" with the actual
    account ID.
      
    - `sessionId`: This field requires the session ID value. It is the unique
    identifier for the current transaction session. Replace "sessionId" with the
    active session ID.
      
    - `source`: This field is for providing the source of the funds for the
    payment. However, in this given case it's null as Zelle doesn't require any
    source.
      
    - `isSaveCharge`: This is a boolean (true or false) field. If set to 'true',
    it means that the charge information for this transaction should be saved
    for future reference or use.


    - `isPrimary`: This is another boolean field. If set to 'true', it implies
    that the current payment method (Zelle) is set as the primary method of
    payment. In this case, it is set to 'false', meaning that Zelle is not the
    primary method.
      
    - `provider`: This field represents the payment provider. In this case, it
    is set to "zelle". You may replace this with other providers if needed.


    Inside the 'options' field, the 'language' is set to 'json'. This indicates
    that the request body is coded in JSON language.
