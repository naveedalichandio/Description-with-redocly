  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Charge - Zelle - Get". It's designed to retrieve
    details about a specific charge from the Zelle payment provider.


    It uses the GET method, which is typically used when you're trying to read
    or retrieve data from a resource.


    "url": This is the path from where the API endpoint can be accessed. It's
    set to "http://localhost:3000/api/payment/charge/get/chargeId". In this URL:

    - "localhost:3000" indicates that the API server is running locally on port
    3000.

    - "api/payment/charge/get/chargeId" is the specific path on the server where
    our endpoint is located. The "chargeId" part in our example is a placeholder
    for the actual charge ID that you need to provide to get charge details.


    The endpoint accepts two query parameters in the URL: 

    - "provider" is used to indicate the payment provider, in this case, it's
    set to "zelle".

    - "accountId" is used to specify the account ID from which the charge was
    made. This should be replaced with the actual account ID.

    - "sessionId" is used to keep track of the user session. The actual session
    ID should be provided here.


    "headers": This field is currently empty, indicating that the endpoint does
    not require any specific HTTP headers. However, in some cases, headers might
    include additional data that is needed for the request, such as API tokens
    or keys for authentication.


    Please note that actual values should replace placeholders accordingly, and
    URL parameters should properly URL encoded if they contain special
    characters or spaces.
