  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Account - Send - Password Changed Notification". It
    is responsible for sending notification when a user changes their password.


    **Authentication:**

    The endpoint requires Bearer authentication. The bearer token needs to be
    provided in under the "token" key.


    Key: 'token'

    Value: 'BearerToken'

    Type: 'string'


    The value is where you'll substitute the actual bearer token when making
    your request.


    **Method:**

    The request method for this endpoint is POST.


    **URL:**

    This endpoint is to be hit at
    'http://localhost:3000/api/account/send/passwordChanged'. This URL is bound
    to change depending on the environment/server where this service is
    deployed.


    **Headers:**

    This endpoint requires one additional header 'Client-UUID' which must be
    included with each request. The value for 'Client-UUID' corresponds to your
    project's unique identifier.


    Key: 'Client-UUID'

    Value: 'ClientUUID'

    Type: 'default'


    **Body:**

    The request body should be in `raw` mode and contains the following keys:


    - sessionId : Represents the ongoing session ID.

    - accountId : The unique identifier of the account.

    - email : The email associated with the account.


    An example body would look like 


    ```json

    {
      "sessionId":"MySessionId",
      "accountId":"MyAccountId",
      "email":"MyEmail"
    }

    ```


    In this example, `MySessionId`, `MyAccountId`, and `MyEmail` should be
    replaced with actual values while making the request.
