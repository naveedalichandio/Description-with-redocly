    1. **name**: This field denotes the name of the endpoint. It indicates that
    this API endpoint is used to manage (delete) comments within a connect
    feature set.


    2. **request**: This field contains all the necessary components to make a
    HTTP request such as the authentication process, the HTTP method, the URL of
    the request, headers (if any), and the body of the request.


    3. **auth**: This is part of the request that deals with the authentication
    process to access the endpoint. Here, it uses Bearer Token authentication.
    This type of authentication is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves
    security tokens called Bearer Tokens.
        - **type**: The type of token required is called a "bearer".
        - **bearer**: An array containing an object that holds information about the token.
        - **key**: The name of the token which is "token".
        - **value**: The value of the token is "sessionId", which indicates that a session id will be used for the authentication process.
        - **type**: Indicates that the field requires a string value.

    4. **method**: This specifies the HTTP method for the request, which is
    'POST' in this case. It is used here because we are deleting information on
    the server. 


    5. **url**: This the URL where the server will receive the HTTP request.
    Here, the request is sent to a local server
    'http://localhost:3000/api/connect/comment/delete'.


    6. **headers**: This is an array that contains an object which could
    potentially hold information to be sent as part of the request header.
    Though in this case, there is no key-value pair provided and has been
    disabled.


    7. **body**: This is the part where additional information or data that is
    needed to complete the HTTP request is provided.
        - **mode**: Tells the mode of the data/input sent with the request. Here it is 'raw', which indicates that the data/input is not processed and is sent as is.
        - **raw**: This is actual data being sent with the request. For this endpoint, the raw data includes a JSON object containing a "sessionId", "accountId", and a "commentId" all of which have respective values. The values need to be replaced with a valid session id, account id, and comment id respectively before sending the request.
      
    Note: It is very important that you have the necessary authorization and
    follow the description precisely to successfully make a request to this
