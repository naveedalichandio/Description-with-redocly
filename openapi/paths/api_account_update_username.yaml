    This endpoint is named "Account - Update - Username" and it is used to
    update the username of an account.


    It uses the "PUT" method of request which means it's designed to update or
    replace existing data.


    The URL for this endpoint is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/update/username". You can replace the
    "localhost:3000" part with the actual server address where your API is
    hosted. 


    Authorization of the request is managed using a "bearer" token which needs
    to be provided in the "auth" field. The key for this is "token" and the
    value should be the actual "BearerToken", which is a unique token assigned
    for each user.


    There is a header field which expects a "Client-UUID", this is essentially
    the unique identifier for each client. The client is expected to send their
    UUID every time they make a request to this endpoint.


    The request body is sent in "raw" mode. The payload contains the new
    "username" that needs to be updated. It also contains a "sessionId" which
    represents the session of the user. The "accountId" is the unique identifier
    of the account that you wish to update the username of.


    In summary, to use this endpoint effectively, you need to include the bearer
    token, the client UUID, and an appropriate payload in the request. If all
    these details are accurate, the username of the specified account will be
    updated successfully.
