    ### Action - Search - Delete Endpoint Description


    #### Request Object

    - **Auth**: This section specifies the authentication method used for the
    API request.
      - **Type**: The type of authentication is "bearer," which means the request will include a token that grants access to the endpoint.
      - **Bearer**: This array contains the details of the bearer token.
        - **Key**: The name of the field, which is "token" in this case.
        - **Value**: This represents where the actual token is stored, referred to as "sessionId."
        - **Type**: Indicates the data type of the value, which is a string.

    - **Method**: The HTTP method for the request is "POST." This means that the
    request is intended to send data to the server to perform an action (in this
    case, deleting a search).


    - **URL**: The endpoint URL for this request is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/action/search/delete." This is the URL on the
    local server where the delete action will be performed.


    - **Headers**: This section includes any additional headers that may be
    necessary for the request.
      - Since there are currently no headers specified (the key and value are empty), this header is disabled and will not be sent with the request.

    #### Request Body

    - **Mode**: The body mode is set to "raw," indicating that the body content
    is sent as plain text rather than in a specific format like form data or
    URL-encoded data.


    - **Raw**: This is the actual data sent within the body of the request. It
    is a JSON string that contains:
      - **sessionId**: A unique identifier for the user's session, used for authentication to verify the identity of the user making the request.
      - **accountId**: This identifies the specific account associated with the action being performed. It allows the server to know which account's search is to be deleted.
      - **searchId**: This represents the unique identifier of the specific search to be deleted. It tells the server which search record should be removed.

    This endpoint is designed to allow users to delete a specific search
    associated with their account by providing the necessary identifiers in the
    request body.
