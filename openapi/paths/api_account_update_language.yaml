    **Endpoint Name:** Account - Update - Language


    This endpoint is used to update the language preference of an account. Below
    is a comprehensive analysis of the data fields involved:


    **Request Authentication:**


    * `auth`: Describes the authentication method. Specifically, the type is
    bearer type authentication. 


    * `bearer` Array: This holds the access token information. 
        * `key`: Refers to the identifier of the token. By default, it is "token".
        * `value`: This is the actual token value used for authorization. Placeholder here is "BearerToken".
        * `type`: This is the data type of the token, and the default is set as "string".

    **Request Method:**


    * `method`: The HTTP method used for the API call. This endpoint uses the
    "PUT" method, implying that it is intended for updating an existing
    resource.


    **Request URL:**


    * `url`: The URL of the API endpoint. For this request, it is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/update/language".


    **Request Headers:**


    * `headers`: This includes extra information sent with the request. Here, a
    "Client-UUID" is sent, which uniquely identifies every client.


    **Request Body:**


    * `body`: This is the main content of the request. In this case, it's in raw
    JSON format.
        * `mode`: Specifies that the request body is raw.
        * `raw`: This includes the essential details viz., language preference ('languagePreference'), a unique session identifier ('sessionId'), and the account identifier ('accountId') of the account for which the language preference needs to be updated. The language preference here is set to Spanish ('es'). 

    This endpoint, thus, takes an Authorization token, client UUID, session ID,
    account ID, and the preferred language to update the language preference of
    the specific account.
