      - Method: This is a 'GET' request, which means that it's used to retrieve data from a specific resource. The 'GET' request is one of the most common HTTP methods and is typically used for querying data from a server.

      - URL: This is the URL that the request is being sent to. The 'http://localhost:3000/api/payment/product/getAll/' suggests that this request is sent to a local server to retrieve all stripe product data. It's important to note that this URL contains query parameters (`?provider=stripe&accountId=accountId&sessionId=sessionId`). These parameters form a part of the URL which is sent to the server to specify certain data.
        - 'provider=stripe': This parameter indicates that the selected payment provider is Stripe.
        - 'accountId=accountId': This parameter should be replaced with the unique identifier for the Stripe account from which you want to retrieve product data.
