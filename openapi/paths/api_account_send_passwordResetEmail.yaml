  description: >-
    Here's a detailed description of each data field in this API endpoint:


    1. "name" - This denotes the name or title of the API endpoint. It's a
    significant identifier that describes what the API endpoint does. In this
    case, "Account - Send - Password Reset Code to Email" suggests that the API
    endpoint is used to transmit password reset codes to email addresses linked
    with user accounts.


    2. "request" - This outlines the specifics of the HTTP request that will be
    made. It includes several sub-components detailing the manner and content of
    the method.


    3. "auth" - This presents information about the authentication protocol that
    the API will employ for the HTTP request. The "type" is "bearer", implying
    that the request will utilize bearer token authentication.
       
        "bearer" is an array comprises a single object carrying three properties:
       
       - "key": Represents the header field for the bearer token, here it is named as "token".
       
       - "value": The actual token/credential that's used for authentication. Here it's called "BearerToken".
       
       - "type": Describes the data type of the "value". In this case, it is a string.

    4. "method" - This data field signifies the HTTP method for the request. In
    this case, "POST" indicates that the endpoint is expecting data to be sent
    in the request body for processing.


    5. "url" - This contains the exact URL that the request will call. Here the
    API endpoint is hosted locally on port 3000.


    6. "headers" - This includes any headers required for the request. In this
    case, a client UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) should be mentioned as
    the header with the key called "Client-UUID".


    7. "body" - This pertains to the main content of the request. "mode" is set
    to "raw", which means the request will be made with the raw data as is,
    without any encoding or modifying. Under "raw", several items need to be
    sent in JSON form:
       
       - "sessionId": A unique identifier for a single browsing session.
       
       - "accountId": Identifier for a specific user account.
       
       - "securityCode": Security code arranged to verify the identity of the user. In this example, its value is set as '123'.
       
       - "email": The email address linked with the user's account. In this case, `fortunevieyra@icloud.com` is the account email where the reset password link will be dispatched.
