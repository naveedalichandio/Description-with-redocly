  description: >-
    This endpoint is titled "Reports - Earning - Get". It performs a GET request
    which is commonly used to retrieve information from a specific resource.


    The request is authenticated using Bearer authentication, which is often
    used for API tokens. The key for auth is 'token' and its value is
    'BearerToken', with the data type being a string.


    The API's base URL for this request is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/reports/earning/get/". Upon it, there are three
    parameters:


    1. 'earningId': An identifier for the specific earnings report you're trying
    to retrieve.

    2. 'sessionId': This could be an identifier for the current session or user
    that is making the request.

    3. 'accountId': It is probably an identifier for the user or system that
    owns this particular earnings report.


    In terms of headers, currently, none are set for this request; the fields
    are left empty and it's set as 'disabled' which means this header won't
    affect the request.


    Lastly, it shows that the 'body' of the request is in the 'raw' mode, but
    it's not sending any data as the 'raw' field is empty. In other words, no
    data is being sent in the body of this API request.
