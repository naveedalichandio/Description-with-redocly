  description: >-
    1. "name": This is the name of the endpoint. In this case, it's called
    "Media - Image - Get - For Public", indicating that this endpoint is used to
    retrieve images for public viewers.


    2. "request": This is the main request object that contains all the
    necessary information to perform a HTTP request. 


    3. "auth": The authentication mechanism used by this endpoint. Here we are
    using the "bearer" type, indicating that we'll be using Bearer
    authentication, a HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens
    called bearer tokens.


    4. "bearer": This object contains details of the bearer token. The "key" is
    the name of the token (in this case, "token"), "value" is the token string
    that you must replace with actual token when making a request (here it's,
    "BearerToken"), and "type" is the data type of this token, which is a
    string.


    5. "method": This shows that the HTTP method used for the request is "GET".
    This method is used to retrieve data from a server.


    6. "url": This is the URL endpoint where the request will be sent. In this
    case, `http://localhost:3000/api/media/image/get/?imageId=imageId&public=1`.
    Replace `imageId` with an actual id of the image you want to retrieve.


    7. "headers": This is an array of headers to be sent along with the request.
    In this instance, no headers are included as the "disabled" field is set to
    true. The "key" and "value" fields are left empty, suggesting no extra
    information is sent in the header.


    8. "body": This section is for the information sent through the HTTP
    request. The "mode" is set to "raw", indicating that the information should
    be sent in raw format. However, the "raw" field is an empty string,
    indicating there's no additional data to be sent in the body of the request.
