  description: >-
    This endpoint, named `Reports - Player - Create`, is a POST request that
    requires the "bearer" authentication type. The bearer token for this
    endpoint must be supplied in the form of a string in the `token` field. The
    endpoint url is `http://localhost:3000/api/reports/player/create`.


    The following JSON body needs to be passed in the raw format with the JSON
    language option:


    - `sessionId`: A unique identification string for the session.

    - `accountId`: A unique identification string for the account.

    - `name`: A string field used to provide the name of the second player.

    - `description`: A string field to describe the player. In the current
    example, the second player is being described.

    - `tags`: A string field for tags related to the player. Multiple tags can
    be separated with commas.

    - `profilePhotoUrl`: A string field for the URL of the player's profile
    photo.

    - `coverPhotoUrl`: A string field for the URL of the player's cover photo.

    - `minimumTipAmount`: An integer indicating the least amount of tip the
    player can receive.

    - `categoryId`: A unique string identifying the category.

    - `category`: A category string, general in application.

    - `subCategoryId`: A unique string identifying the sub-category. 

    - `subCategory`: A string specifying the sub-category, more specific in
    application.

    - `isPlayerPrivate`: A boolean field which when set to true makes the player
    private.

    - `isTournamentOnly`: A boolean field indicating if the player is for
    tournaments only.

    - `isPlayerDefault`: A boolean field indicating if the player is set as the
    default.

    - `isPreLiveReportsAds`: A boolean field indicating if the ads are to be
    displayed before live reports.

    - `isPostLiveReportsAds`: A boolean field indicating if the ads are to be
    displayed after live reports.

    - `breakPreLiveReportsUrl`: A string field for the URL of the pre-live
    report break video.

    - `breakPostLiveReportsUrl`: A string field for the URL of the post-live
    report break video.


    All these fields must be enclosed in double-quotes (`"`). Moreover, ensure
    the fields are separated by commas (`,`). The entire JSON body must be
    enclosed in curly braces (`{}`). There are currently no custom request
    headers in the endpoint, hence that part is disabled.
