    This endpoint is named "Account - Update - Email". This specifies its
    purpose: It's a component in an API that facilitates email updates in an
    account. 


    - The `request` field contains the defining features of the endpoint's
    request parameters. 


    - The `auth` form of this endpoint is "bearer". This signifies that it uses
    bearer tokens for authorization. The token's details are stored in a
    subfield where "key" is "token", the "value" is "BearerToken" and the token
    type is set to "string".


    - The `method` details the type of HTTP request that should be made. In this
    case, it's a `PUT` request indicating that it's used to update current
    resource.


    - The `url` field provides the exact location at which the request should be
    pointed. Here, it's targeted at the
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/update/email" endpoint. 


    - Inside the `headers` is a single object that indicates "Client-UUID" as a
    "key" with a "value" of "ClientUUID". The type of this header is "default".
    This header might be used to specify the unique identifier of the client
    making the request.


    - The `body` of the request includes three parameters packed into a raw JSON
    payload. The `mode` is set to "raw" indicating the form in which the body
    data is sent.

      - The `newEmail` field is likely expected to receive the updated email address. For example, "fortunevieyra@icloud.com" has been used in the placeholder.

      - `sessionId` is likely a unique identifier for the session during which the request is made. 

      - The `accountId` is probably the unique identifier of the account for which the email is to be updated. 

    Each of these fields and their particular values work together to form the
    complete functionality of this endpoint. Be sure to replace placeholders
    with actual data before use.
