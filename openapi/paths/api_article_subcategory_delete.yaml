  summary: Article - SubCategory - Delete
  description: >-
    This endpoint is labeled as "Article - SubCategory - Delete". It required
    bearer authentication type which means the API won't work without a proper
    authorization. The authentication uses a bearer token which usually
    represents the logged-in user session, identified by the key "token" and
    takes a string value "sessionId".


    The HTTP request method for this endpoint is POST. It's typically used to
    send data to a server to create a new resource. 


    The URL for this endpoint is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/article/subcategory/delete". This URL suggests
    that it will be interacting with the subcategories under articles.
    Specifically, it appears that it will be used to delete an item based on the
    route "/delete". It's highly likely that it's used to delete an article's
    subcategory.


    The default header key is not provided in the endpoint, hence the empty
    strings (""). The "disabled" field indicates the headers are disabled for
    this endpoint, meaning that the headers won't be sent along with the
    request.


    The request body is in raw json format, which directly embodies all the
    information needed for the request. Within that message body, there are
    three fields included: 


    1. "sessionId" which probably is used to keep the current logged-in user's
    session. 

    2. "accountId" might be used to represent a specific user account that the
    session belong to. 

    3. "subCategoryId" that seemingly represents the identification of the
    subcategory in an article that you want to delete. 


    This endpoint appears to be deleting an article's subcategory of an account
    with a verified session.
