  description: >-
    This endpoint, named "Incentive - Reward - Get All", is designed to retrieve
    all types of promotional incentives offered to users, such as loyalty
    bonuses, referrals, discount codes, gift vouchers, etc.


    It works with the GET method, meaning it's a read-only view which retrieves
    and displays data from server. This operation is authenticated using the
    "Bearer" type of token authorization. The place of the token is marked as
    "BearerToken", which is meant to hold the actual API client's bearer token
    as a string to grant access level.


    The request is delivered to the URL:
    "http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/reward/all/", and requires two query
    parameters: 'sessionId' and 'accountId'. 'sessionId' refers to the unique ID
    of the user's current session, and 'accountId' is a unique identifier for
    the user's account. Both are mandatory and should be passed in the URL to
    ensure the proper functioning of the endpoint by tailoring the response to
    the specific user and session.


    The endpoint does not require any specific headers, as indicated by the
    empty key-value pair, and it is also disabled, meaning it can be disregarded
    entirely in the request.


    In terms of the request body, since this endpoint is using the GET method,
    no data needs to be sent through the body. It's set to the 'raw' mode, yet
    the 'raw' body field is left blank. This is to be expected, as GET methods
    typically do not have a request body. If there's any change in the type of
    request made to this endpoint, then the body parameters would need to be
    added under the 'raw' field.
