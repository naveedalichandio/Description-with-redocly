    This endpoint is called 'Connect - Post - Delete'. It's a POST method,
    meaning it is used to send data to the server to create a resource.


    The 'auth' field indicates the type of authentication being used, which is
    'bearer' type. The 'bearer' array contains a 'token' key needing a
    'sessionId' value. It's of 'string' type, which indicates that the
    'sessionId' must be a sequence of characters.


    The 'method' is 'POST', which is typically used to submit data to be
    processed by the identified resource.


    The 'url' is the web address where the POST request is sent. In this case,
    it's 'http://localhost:3000/api/connect/post/delete', which is an API
    related to deleting a post on a server running on your own machine (or
    localhost) at port 3000.


    The 'headers' field includes a default key-value pair that is currently
    empty and disabled. Headers are used for additional parameters that need to
    be sent with the API request. 


    The 'body' field contains the Data that will be sent with the POST request,
    which is in 'raw' mode. 'Raw' mode in Postman allows you to send data as a
    string in the format that you choose. This requires an object containing
    sessionId, accountId, and postId as strings in a JSON format. 


    'sessionId' is an unique identifier for a browser session and can be used to
    manage a user's interaction with the application. 'accountId' refers to the
    unique identifier of a user's account while 'postId' is the unique
    identifier of a specific post on the platform. All of these identifiers are
    sent in the request body indicating the specific user, session and post
    involved in the interaction.
