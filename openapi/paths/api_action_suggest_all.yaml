    **Request**:  

    This section contains the details of how to make the API request.


    - **Auth**:  
      Contains information about the authentication method used for this request.
      
      - **Type**:  
        Specifies the authentication type as "bearer", which indicates that a bearer token will be used for authentication.
        
      - **Bearer**:  
        This is an array containing details about the bearer token required to authorize the request.
        
        - **Key**:  
          Indicates the name of the bearer token parameter. In this case, it's labeled "token".
          
        - **Value**:  
          Represents the actual authorization token that needs to be sent with the request. Here it is shown as "BearerToken", and users should replace this with their actual token.
          
        - **Type**:  
          Shows that the token should be sent as a string.

    - **Method**:  
      The HTTP method to be used for this request is "GET". This means that the request is intended to retrieve data from the server.

    - **URL**:  
      The endpoint URL where the request will be sent. In this case:
      `http://localhost:3000/api/action/suggest/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId`. Users should replace `sessionId` and `accountId` with actual values relevant to their session and account.

    - **Headers**:  
      This section allows for additional data to be sent along with the request, which can help facilitate the communication between the client and server.
      
      - **Key**:  
        A string intended for the header's name. This is currently empty.
        
      - **Value**:  
        The value associated with the header's key, which is also empty. Together, this header is disabled and does not contribute to the request.

    - **Body**:  
      This section contains data that can be sent with the request, although for a GET request, a body is typically not used.
      
      - **Mode**:  
        Specifies the mode of the request body, which is set to "raw". This means the body is intended to carry raw data.
        
      - **Raw**:  
        This is the area where the raw body data would be entered. Currently, it is empty since a GET request does not usually include a body.
