    This endpoint is named "Account - Location - Delete", suggesting it is used
    to remove a location record associated with a certain account.


    Authorization for this endpoint is provided through a bearer token. The
    "key" is named "token" and its "value" is obtained from a session ID, which
    is represented as a string.


    The request method for this endpoint is POST. This implies that it sends
    data to the server to create a new resource (in this case, a deletion
    request).


    The URL designated for this endpoint is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/location/delete". This is where the
    server listens for incoming requests. It's on your local machine,
    specifically, as is indicated by "localhost:3000".


    There's an array of headers in the request where you can set additional
    information about the request. It currently contains a default header with
    empty key-value pair that is disabled.


    The "body" section carries the data for the request. Its mode is "raw" which
    means the data is sent as is, a JSON payload in this case. The "raw" field
    contains a JSON string which includes "sessionId", "accountId", and
    "locationId". This implies that the deletion operation should target the
    "locationId" attached to an "accountId" within the current "sessionId".


    Recap: This endpoint deletes a location associated with a given account in
    the provided session, as indicated by the respective IDs in the request
    body. It uses bearer token authorization parsed from a session ID.
