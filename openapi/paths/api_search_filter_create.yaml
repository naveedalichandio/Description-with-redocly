    EndPoint: "Search - Filter - Create"


    1. "auth": All requests made to this endpoint must be authenticated via
    bearer tokens. The "bearer" array contains an object where "key" is the
    attribute you should provide during the bearer token authentication scheme;
    this defaults to "token". "value" is the actual bearer token string you need
    to provide for authorization. The token type should be "string".


    2. "method": Defines the HTTP method to use when sending data to the API.
    For this endpoint, the "POST" method is used, implying data is sent as a
    request body.


    3. "url": This field indicates the URL to which the API call should be made.
    The given URL for this endpoint is:
    "http://localhost:3000/api/search/filter/create"


    4. "headers": This field allows to send additional header parameters along
    with the request. As in this example, no headers are required, as indicated
    by an empty "key" and "value" and the attribute "disabled" set to true.
    Thus, no additional headers need to be sent for this endpoint.


    5. "body": Represents data that is sent to the API endpoint in the HTTP POST
    method.
       
       i. "mode": Specifies the formatting mode for the request body. Here, it is indicated as "raw", which allows you to write the request parameters freehand.
      
       ii. "raw": A string of JSON content that is required to be sent as the body of the request. In this case, it includes various data such as "queryId", "accountId", "sessionId" and a complex "filter" object which includes various filter criteria like "type", "sort", "privacy", "date", "team", "stream", and "loyalty". Each piece of filter criteria has different variables that can be adjusted for search (like "channel" in "type", "popular" in "sort" or "loyalty", etc.)
       
       iii. "options": This section defines the format of the request body. It specifies "raw" as the format and "json" as the language. This implies that the request body is in raw JSON format. 

    In general, to use the endpoint you need to perform a POST method with a
    bearer token provided in the authorization, to the given URL. The request
    body should contain a JSON object as described above, but no additional
    headers are necessary.
