  summary: Incentive - Reward - Update
  description: >-
    This API endpoint is named "Incentive - Reward - Update". It is designed to
    update an existing reward in the incentive program. Here are the main
    components:


    Authentication ("auth"): This endpoint uses bearer token authentication. You
    need to provide a token in the 'BearerToken' field to authenticate your
    request.


    Request Type ("method"): The type of the request is PUT which means it is
    used to update or replace an existing resource.


    URL ("url"): The URL to send the request to is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/reward/update".


    Headers: This request contains one header, "Client-UUID". This is presumably
    uniquely identifying your client to the server.


    Request Body ("body"): This contains all the information needed to update a
    reward. It is in raw JSON format. The fields are:


    - "sessionId": The unique identifier of the current session.

    - "accountId": The unique identifier of the account.

    - "rewardId": The unique identifier of the reward.

    - "name": The name of the reward.

    - "description": A short explanation about the reward.

    - "tags": A list of tags describing the reward, which can be used for search
    or categorisation.

    - "rewardType": The type of reward (in this case, "token").

    - "rewardTypeId": A unique identifier for the reward type.

    - "tokenAmount": The amount of tokens provided by the reward.

    - "profilePhotoUrl": A URL referencing an image which represents the reward.

    - "coverPhotoUrl": A URL pointing to the reward's cover photo.

    - "videoPlaybackUrl": If there is any video associated with the reward, its
    URL will be placed here.

    - "audioPlaybackUrl": URL for any audio file related to the reward.


    Options ("options"): These specify that the body is to be interpreted as raw
    JSON input.


    Remember, the values provided here - such as "BearerToken", "ClientUUID",
    and the placeholder values in the body - are just placeholders. You need to
    replace them with your actual data before making a request.
