  description: >-
    This endpoint is titled "Notification - Channels - Delete". As the name
    suggests, it is made for deleting a notification channel.


    The endpoint requires "bearer" type authorization. Here, the bearer token
    must be provided to handle authentication and authorization to use this
    endpoint. The key for the bearer token is "token" and the value should be
    the "sessionId". The "sessionId" should be a string type value, representing
    the ID of the active session.


    This endpoint is accessed via the "POST" method indicating that you're
    supplying information to be processed by the server.


    The URL to send this POST method is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/channels/delete". Upon successful
    operation, this endpoint will remove the respective notification channel.


    There are headers in the request but they are disabled and empty by default.
    Though they are present, they aren't required or being used currently.


    Inside the "body" of the request, you'll notice it's in "raw" mode meaning
    you can enter any text. However, it expects a JSON object that contains
    three fields:


    1. The "sessionId" field, which should be a string type value, stands for
    the session identifier.

    2. The "accountId" field is also a string type value. This represents the
    account identifier from which you want to delete the notification channel.

    3. The "channelsId" field denotes the identifier of channels that is to be
    deleted from the account.


    Please remember, while filling out the data in the body, ensure that you're
    following the provided JSON format.
