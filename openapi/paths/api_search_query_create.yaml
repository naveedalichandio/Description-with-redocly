  summary: Search - Query - Create
  description: >-
    This endpoint is called "Search - Query - Create". It is designed to take in
    user-provided information and use it to create a new query that will then be
    sent to a search database. 


    - "name": Provides the name of the endpoint. In this case, it is "Search -
    Query - Create".


    The "request" object contains all the information required to make the API
    request.


    - "auth": This field refers to the authorization mechanism for the API
    request. In this scenario, the type of the authorization mechanism is
    "bearer". A bearer token is required to authorize the API request.
      
    - "bearer": This contains the bearer token. It is a simple security token
    that the client can send to the server to authenticate requests.


    - "method": This field signifies the type of HTTP method to be used when
    making a request to the URL. It's set to "POST" which indicates that data
    should be sent to the server to create a new resource.


    - "url": This is the URL where the API request is to be made. In this case,
    the URL points to a search API at
    "http://localhost:3000/api/search/query/create".


    The "headers" object contains the headers information to be sent along with
    the API request.


    - "key" and "value": These fields are empty in this case and they are
    disabled. For actual application, we should provide header key-value pairs
    depending on server requirements.


    The "body" element stores the actual data to be sent with the HTTP request:


    - "mode": It refers to the mode of the body data and it is set to "raw",
    implying that the body content will be sent as a string of text.


    - "raw": Contains a JSON string with various details for the search query
    such as the query term, account ID, session ID, and usage metrics (device,
    browser, region, year, month, week, day, hour).


    - "options": This field defines the language to use for the raw data. In
    this example, the raw data is written in JSON.


    Each attribute in the "raw" field has a specific meaning:


    - "query": The actual search query itself, i.e., the term being searched.

    - "accountId": The ID of the account making the search.

    - "sessionId": The ID of the session during which the search was made.

    - "metrics": Provides detailed information about how the search was
    conducted. It includes specifications of the device used, browser used,
    region from where the search was made, and precise time the search was
    initiated(year, month, week, day, hour).


    This endpoint can be utilized to create a detailed search query by providing
    the necessary details in the body of the request.
