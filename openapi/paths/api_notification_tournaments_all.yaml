  description: >-
    This data endpoint is titled `Notification - Tournaments - Get All`. As the
    name suggests, it is used to retrieve all the notifications related to
    tournaments. 


    It uses the `GET` method, indicating its primary purpose is to retrieve
    information. The endpoints URL is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/notification/tournaments/all/`, where
    `localhost:3000` is the local server address, and
    `/api/notification/tournaments/all/` is the specific path to the endpoint.


    This endpoint requires Bearer Token Authentication, which is a method for an
    HTTP user agent to provide a single-string token to the server. The token is
    provided as a value in the `BearerToken` field under `auth`. It is a type of
    `string`.


    Two query parameters are attached to the URL: `sessionId` and `accountId`.
    These parameters should be replaced with the respective session ID and
    account ID of the user.


    The `headers` field in the request is currently empty and disabled. Headers
    are often used to provide additional information about the request or
    response.


    The `body` of the request contains a `mode` field set to `"raw"`, suggesting
    that raw data can be sent in the body of the request. However, because this
    is a `GET` request, there is no body content or `raw` field provided as it's
    usually used with `POST` or `PUT` requests to send data to the server.


    Please replace `BearerToken`, `sessionId`, and `accountId` with actual
    values when using this endpoint.
