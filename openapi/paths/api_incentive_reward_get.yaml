  description: >-
    1. **name**: "Incentive - Reward - Get". This is the name for this specific
    endpoint that fetches the reward data related to an incentive program. Use
    it to conveniently identify this request among others in your collection.


    2. **request.auth.type**: "bearer". This denotes the type of authorization
    used for this request which is 'bearer' token in this case. Bearer token
    authorization leverages a security token for authorization management.


    3. **request.auth.bearer**: It is an array of object. The object contains
    three properties:
        - **key**: "token". It is the type of authorization value you are going to use.
        - **value**: "BearerToken". This would be the actual token value. Replace 'BearerToken' with the actual token when making a real API call.
        - **type**: "string". It represents the data type of token and it is a string.

    4. **request.method**: "GET". This is the HTTP method used for this request.
    'GET' method is used to retrieve information from the server.


    5. **request.url**:
    "http://localhost:3000/api/incentive/reward/get/?rewardId=rewardId&sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId".
    This is the URL where the request will be sent. The URL contains three query
    parameters - rewardId, sessionId and accountId. Replace these parameters
    with actual values when making a real API call.


    6. **request.headers**: An array used to define any headers to be sent along
    with the request. In this case, no headers are required as the object inside
    the array is empty and disabled.


    7. **request.body.mode**: "raw". Indicates that the request body will be
    sent as a raw string. However, in this GET request, there is no need to send
    a body, hence the raw value is an empty string.


    8. **request.body.raw**: ""(empty string). As it's a GET request, it does
    not contain a body. It means no additional data is sent to the server.
