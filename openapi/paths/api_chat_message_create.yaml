  description: >-
    This endpoint, named "Chat - Message - Create", is a method to create a new
    chat message on the server. 


    It uses the 'POST' method, aiming at the URL
    "http://localhost:3000/api/chat/message/create". The authentication type
    required for this endpoint is "bearer". We use the BearerToken as the
    authentication token provided under "auth" property with key "token".


    The body of the request contains raw JSON data with the following fields:


    1. "messageText": This should contain the text of the chat message being
    sent. Type for this field is a string.
       
    2. "messagePriority": This is to mark the priority of the message. It's a
    string where "0" could perhaps denote a standard message.
       
    3. "fromAccountId": This refers to the account id from which the message is
    originating. It should be a string presenting an accountId.
       
    4. "toAccountId": This is the account id to which the message should be
    sent. A string is expected here as well.
       
    5. "threadId": This could be used for threading or grouping messages. The
    current message will belong to this thread. It's expected to be represented
    as a string.
       
    6. "replyToId": If the current message is a reply to any other message, that
    message's id should be specified here. This field should be a string.
       
    7. "accountId": This could denote the user who is currently logged in and
    performing the action. The representation of this field is a string.
       
    8. "sessionId": It may be used to maintain the session of the user who is
    making the request. The value here is expected to be a string.


    All these fields are marked as strings wrapped in JSON format, according to
    "options -> raw -> language". This endpoint doesn't require any specific
    headers to be set.
