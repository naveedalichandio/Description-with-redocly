    This endpoint is called "Notification - Users - Create". It's a POST request
    used to create a new user in the notification system. The request is
    authenticated using a bearer token which should be provided in the 'token'
    field inside the 'auth' object. The endpoint URL is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/users/create".


    There is an empty key-value pair in the headers object that is disabled by
    default. However, if any headers are required for your specific situation,
    you can enter them here.


    The main content of this request is in the 'body' object, which contains
    several fields. Please ensure that you post the content in the 'raw' mode. 


    The 'raw' body of the request is provided in JSON format and includes the
    user's session ID, account ID, name, a description of the user, tags
    associated with the user, URLs for the user's profile and cover photos, the
    minimum amount that can be tipped to the user, category details (both
    primary and sub-category), privacy settings, whether the user is only for
    tournaments, whether the user is default, whether pre-live and post-live ads
    are displayed during the user's notifications, and URLs for pre and
    post-live breaks.


    It's essential that these fields are filled out completely and accurately,
    as they create a full profile for the user in the notification system.
    Ensure all URLs and IDs are valid, and boolean fields are correctly set to
    either true or false. The 'minimumTipAmount' field expects a numerical value
    for the minimum tip amount.
