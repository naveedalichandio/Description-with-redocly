    This is the "Reports - Team - Create" endpoint used to create a new team
    report. The endpoint uses the POST method to send data to the server to

    - "auth": This object is used for authentication. It uses the "bearer" type
    which requires a "BearerToken" to verify the user's identity.

    this case, a 'POST' request is being made, which is used to send data to the

    headers to be included in the request. While the provided headers in this
    example are empty and disabled, they could typically include content type,
    date, server, and more.


    - "body.mode": This field identifies how the request body should be
    formatted. Here, it is specified as 'raw', which means it will send
    unprocessed data to the server.

    includes fields such as sessionId, accountId, team details, category and
    subcategory details, privacy settings, report ads settings, and URL for pre
    and post live report breaks.
