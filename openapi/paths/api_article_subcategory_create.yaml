    1. `name`: This represents the name of the API endpoint. In this case, it's
    "Article - SubCategory - Create Auto". This is also likely what the endpoint
    is used for, which is to create auto subcategories for articles.


    2. `request`: This includes all the details related to the HTTP request
    method, endpoint URL, headers, body, and authorization type used in the API
    call. 


    3. `auth`: This section provides details about the type of authentication
    being used. Here, the type is "bearer", which indicates bearer token
    authentication is used for this request. A bearer token, represented by the
    `key` value pair of "token" and "BearerToken", is sent for authorization.


    4. `method`: The HTTP method for this request is "POST", which is mostly
    used to send data to a server to create a new resource.


    5. `url`: This is the URL endpoint where the API call is being made. This
    endpoint is used to create a new subcategory under the article's category.


    6. `headers`: These are the default headers for the request. In this case,
    the header key and value are both empty and disabled.


    7. `body`: This is the data which is sent to the server. This data is sent
    in raw JSON format. It contains several fields: 

       - `sessionId`: This is likely an identifier for the session in which the API call is being made.
       - `accountId`: This could be an identifier for the user or system making the API call.
       - `displayName`: This is the name that will be displayed for the new subcategory.
       - `description`: Provides a description of the new subcategory being created.
       - `tags`: These are keywords associated with the new subcategory.
       - `category`: This is the parent category under which the new subcategory is created.

    8. `options`: This field specifies that the request body "raw" data is in
    JSON format.
