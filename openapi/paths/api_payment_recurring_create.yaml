  summary: Recurring - Zelle - Create
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Recurring - Zelle - Create" it is called via a POST
    method. It's used to create a new recurring payment with the Zelle service.


    URL: The endpoint URL is
    [http://localhost:3000/api/payment/recurring/create]. This URL is structured
    specifically for the testing environment with the localhost address and is
    likely to change in production.


    Headers: The request does not require any specific headers. 


    Body: The request body should be a JSON object containing several
    properties:


    1. `accountId`: This is a required field. It should be a string that
    provides the account ID associated with the user. The user's transactions
    will be performed in reference to this account ID.


    2. `sessionId`: This is another required field. It should be a string that
    provides the unique session ID. This is presumably used for tracking
    individual sessions to verify the user's state and track activities.


    3. `source`: This field can be set to null. If necessary, it could include
    more information about the transaction or user.


    4. `isSaveRecurring`: This field should be a boolean. If set to true, it
    indicates that the transaction is a recurring one and should be saved for
    potential future recurring transactions.


    5. `isPrimary`: This field should be a boolean. If set to true, it will set
    the transaction as a primary transaction for the user's account.


    6. `provider`: This field should be a string indicating the payment
    provider. In this case, the provider is "zelle". This is essential in
    determining how the transaction will be processed, according to the payment
    provider.


    Options: The options field provides additional settings for the body field.
    Here, it's set to "language": "json" indicating that the body field should
    be parsed as JSON.


    Overall, this endpoint helps to facilitate recurring payments with Zelle, an
    online payment method, making it easier to handle automated transactions.
