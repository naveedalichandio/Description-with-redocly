  description: >-
    This endpoint is called "Notification - Messages - Get All". It is used to
    fetch all the notification messages from the provided `sessionId` and
    `accountId`. Here's the breakdown of the data:


    1. Auth: This endpoint requires bearer authentication, meaning appropriate
    credentials must be presented before accessing this endpoint. The `token` is
    passed as bearer authentication in the request header. Replace `BearerToken`
    with your actual bearer token string.


    2. Method: This endpoint uses the 'GET' method, that is it's used for
    retrieving data.


    3. URL: The endpoint URL is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/notification/messages/all/`. Two query parameters
    `sessionId` and `accountId` need to be passed. Replace `sessionId` and
    `accountId` in the url with your actual session ID and account ID
    respectively.


    4. Headers: There is a default header included in the request but it's
    disabled and doesn't contain any key or value. Feel free to add any headers
    if needed.


    5. Body: The request body is in 'raw' JSON format. However, the 'raw' field
    is currently empty, indicating that this GET request does not require a body
    as it's primarily used to retrieve data.


    Note: Make sure you replace `BearerToken`, `sessionId` and `accountId` with
    your actual values before making the request.
