    ### Endpoint Description: Action - Review - Get All


    This API endpoint retrieves all reviews associated with actions. Below is a
    detailed description of each component of the request.


    - **Name**: Action - Review - Get All  
      This is the name of the API request. It indicates that the endpoint is used to get all reviews related to actions.

    - **Request**: 
      The main section where the details of the API request are defined.

      - **Auth**:  
        Specifies the authentication method used for the API call.
        
        - **Type**: `bearer`  
          This indicates that the API uses Bearer Token authentication.
          
        - **Bearer**:  
          An array that contains a single object for the token.
          
          - **Key**: `token`  
            The key used to signify the token in the authorization header.
            
          - **Value**: `BearerToken`  
            A placeholder string for the actual Bearer Token required for authentication. Users should replace `BearerToken` with their actual token.
            
          - **Type**: `string`  
            This denotes that the value of the token is a string data type.
            
      - **Method**: `GET`  
        This specifies that the request method is GET, which means it will retrieve data from the server.

      - **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/action/review/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId`  
        The endpoint URL for the API request. It consists of the base URL followed by the specific route to access all reviews. It also includes two query parameters:
        
        - **sessionId**: a placeholder for the unique identifier of the session. This should be replaced with the actual session ID.
        
        - **accountId**: a placeholder for the unique identifier of the account. This should be replaced with the actual account ID.

      - **Headers**:  
        An array that allows you to specify any additional HTTP headers for the request.
        
        - **Key**: `""`  
          In this case, there are no custom headers defined as the key is empty.
          
        - **Value**: `""`  
          Similarly, since the key is empty, there is no value defined.
          
        - **Type**: `default`  
          Indicates the type of the header, which defaults to standard headers.
          
        - **Disabled**: `true`  
          This means that the header configuration is currently disabled and will not be sent with the request.
          
      - **Body**:  
        Contains the data to be sent with the request.
        
        - **Mode**: `raw`  
          This indicates that the body of the request is in raw format.
          
        - **Raw**: `""`  
          The body is empty, meaning no additional data is sent with the request. This is typical for GET requests where no body is required. 

    This detailed description serves to help users understand how to interact
    with the endpoint correctly and what information they need to prepare when
    making a request to retrieve action reviews.
