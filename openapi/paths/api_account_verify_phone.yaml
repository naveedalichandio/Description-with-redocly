  summary: Account - Verify - Phone Number
  description: >-
    This endpoint is for the `Account - Verify - Phone Number` API.


    **Method**: POST

    The HTTP method used for this endpoint is a POST request. It's typically
    used to send data to a server to create a new resource.


    **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/account/verify/phone`

    This is the URL at which the API needs to be hit. Since we're in a local
    development environment, we're using `localhost`. The port we're using to
    access the local server is `3000`. The path of the API is
    `/api/account/verify/phone`, which is used to verify an account's phone
    number.


    **Headers**: []

    This field is empty, meaning we're not sending any additional metadata in
    the header of this HTTP request. Headers often include items like
    authorization tokens, content type etc. However, none of that is required by
    this endpoint.


    **Body**:

    The body of the HTTP request is sent in a `raw` format. This is the data
    that the API takes as input in order to verify a phone number.


    - `verificationCode`: This is the code that is used to verify a phone
    number. Typically, it's sent by an SMS to the phone number that needs to be
    verified. 


    - `phone`: This is the phone number that needs to be verified. It needs to
    be provided so the API knows which phone number it's supposed to verify.


    This endpoint requires both `verificationCode` and `phone` to be present in
    the raw JSON body of the HTTP request in order to work correctly.


    Example of the request body would be:

    ```

    {
      "verificationCode": "123456",
      "phone": "+1234567890"
    }

    ```


    Make sure to replace the values with the actual verification code received
    and the phone number to be verified.
