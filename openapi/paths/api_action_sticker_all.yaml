    ### Endpoint Description


    #### Name

    - **Action - Sticker - Get All**: This endpoint retrieves all sticker
    actions available for the user.


    #### Request Details


    1. **Authentication** 
       - **Type**: Bearer
       - **Bearer**: This section contains an authorization token that is required to access the endpoint.
         - **Key**: `token` - This is the name of the authorization key.
         - **Value**: `BearerToken` - This is a placeholder for the actual bearer token that must be provided to authenticate the request. Users must replace it with a valid token.
         - **Type**: `string` - Indicates that the value of the token is a string.

    2. **Method**
       - **GET**: This specifies that the endpoint uses the GET method, which is typically used for retrieving data from the server.

    3. **URL**
       - **Endpoint URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/action/sticker/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId` - This is the URL used to access the endpoint. It includes query parameters:
         - **sessionId**: A placeholder for the user's session identifier. Must be replaced with an actual session ID.
         - **accountId**: A placeholder for the user's account identifier. Must be replaced with an actual account ID.

    4. **Headers**
       - The headers section is currently empty and disabled. Users can add any necessary headers for their request here, but as it stands, no additional headers are required.

    5. **Body**
       - **Mode**: `raw` - This indicates that the body of the request is in raw format.
       - **Raw**: This field is empty, meaning no request body is sent with the GET request. GET requests typically do not include a body.

    ### Usage Notes

    - Ensure that you replace `BearerToken`, `sessionId`, and `accountId` with
    appropriate values before making the request.

    - Since this is a GET request, it is primarily used to retrieve information
    from the server, and no data is sent in the body of the request.
