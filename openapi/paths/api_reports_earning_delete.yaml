    **Endpoint Name:**


    Reports - Earning - Delete: An endpoint for deleting earning reports.


    **Request:**


    - Authentication: The API endpoint uses bearer token authentication. Ensure
    that the bearer token you provide here is a valid session identifier. In the
    input data, you'll find a `key` titled `token` with a `value` identifier
    named `sessionId`. The `type` of these data fields is a string.


    - Method: The HTTP request method for this endpoint is POST, used primarily
    to send data to the server to create/update a resource.


    - URL: The URL to communicate with the API is
    `http://localhost:3000/api/reports/earning/delete`. This endpoint
    specifically deals with deleting earning reports.


    - Headers: The headers here include a default `key` and `value` pair which
    are both empty and disabled, implying that no additional headers are
    required for this particular API call.


    **Body:**


    This refers to the actual content or data you're sending to the server
    through your HTTP request, containing the following information:


    - Mode: The mode of the data encapsulated in the body of this request is
    identified as `raw`. In simple terms, this implies that the data is sent in
    an unprocessed manner, as a string of text.


    - Raw: The `Raw` field is where the actual data to be sent to the server is
    embedded. In this case, the raw data is in JSON format and it contains three
    strings: `sessionId`, `accountId`, and `earningId`. These are all
    identifiers; `sessionId` pertains to the session in context, `accountId`
    relates to the user account and `earningId` is the unique identifier for the
    specific earning report you wish to delete.
