    ### Endpoint Description: Action - Read - Get All

    - **Name**: Action - Read - Get All
      - This refers to a specific API operation designed to retrieve all actions stored in the database.

    - **Request**:
      - **Auth**:
        - **Type**: Bearer
          - This indicates that the request requires authentication via a bearer token.
          - **Bearer**: Provides details for authentication.
            - **Key**: 
              - `token`
                - This represents the authentication key required by the API to authorize the request.
            - **Value**: 
              - `BearerToken`
                - This is where the actual bearer token must be placed for authentication. Replace `BearerToken` with a valid token to access the API.
            - **Type**: 
              - `string`
                - Designates that the expected value for the token is a string.

      - **Method**:
        - **GET**
          - This specifies that the request will be using the HTTP GET method, which is typically used to retrieve data from the server.

      - **URL**:
        - `http://localhost:3000/api/action/read/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId`
          - This is the endpoint URL where the API can be accessed.
          - `sessionId` and `accountId` are query parameters that must be filled in with appropriate values to identify the session and account for which actions are being retrieved.

      - **Headers**:
        - An empty header is defined but currently disabled.
          - **Key**: `""`
            - This part is where you can specify custom headers if needed.
          - **Value**: `""`
            - The expected value for the custom header, currently left blank.
          - **Type**: 
            - `default`
              - Indicates the type of the header, which is default in this case.
          - **Disabled**: 
            - `true`
              - This means this particular header will not be sent with the request.

      - **Body**:
        - **Mode**: 
          - `raw`
            - Indicates that the body of the request is sent in raw format.
        - **Raw**: 
          - `""`
            - The body of the request is currently empty, as this is a GET request where typically no body is included.
