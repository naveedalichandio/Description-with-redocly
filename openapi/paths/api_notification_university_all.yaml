  description: >-
    This endpoint named "Notification - University - Get All" serves as a GET
    request to retrieve all university notifications.


    1. **Auth**: This endpoint utilizes bearer token authentication. It requires
    a "token" key in which the assigned value should be a "BearerToken". A
    bearer token is a type of access token which grants the bearer or holder of
    the token, the authorization to access this endpoint. The value is a string
    datatype.


    2. **Method**: The type of HTTP request method used is "GET". This method
    retrieves data from a particular URL. It does not modify or add to the data
    on the server, it only requests and receives data.


    3. **URL**: This is the unique address where the request will be sent. It's
    designed for a local server running on port 3000. The full URL structure
    includes two query string parameters;
    localhost:3000/api/notification/university/all/?sessionId={sessionId}&accountId={accountId}. 
        - `sessionId` is a parameter which holds the value of the current session. This is mainly used for state management.
        - `accountId` is the unique identifier for a user account. This could be used to retrieve notifications related only to this specific account.

    4. **Headers**: In this case, there are default headers attached to the
    request that are currently disabled - meaning these headers are not sent
    along with the request. Since both key and value are not provided, these
    headers do not carry any additional information for the request.


    5. **Body**: As a GET request, this endpoint does not send any data (raw or
    form data) in the request body. Hence, the "mode" key is set to "raw" with
    an empty "raw" key.
