  summary: Notification - Invites - Delete
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Notification - Invites - Delete". It is designed to
    handle the deletion of invite notifications.


    Let's break down the contents:


    1. **Auth** - The endpoint uses bearer authentication, implying that it
    requires a token for validation. The key for this token is "token" and the
    value expected is "sessionId". The type of the token is specified as a
    "string". You need to provide a valid session ID as your token to access
    this endpoint.


    2. **Method** - The HTTP method used is "POST", meaning this endpoint is
    used to send data to the server to create a new resource.


    3. **URL** - The endpoint's URL, where the request is sent, is specified as
    "http://localhost:3000/api/notification/invites/delete". Bear in mind this
    is a local URL and might be different in production or other environments.


    4. **Headers** - Headers can be used to provide additional information about
    the request. In this case, the key and value are empty, and the type is set
    as "default". Also, this option is currently disabled.


    5. **Body** - The request body here is in raw format. This contains the
    actual information that is to be sent to the server. It's a JSON with the
    keys "sessionId", "accountId", and "invitesId" which presumably refer to the
    session, account, and invites identifiers, respectively.


    Remember that incorrect auth tokens, URLs or body parameters could lead to
    unsuccessful requests. Use valid information according to your database to
    avoid such issues.
