    ### Endpoint Description: University - General - Get


    **Request Method**: GET  

    This endpoint is used to retrieve information about a specific university. 


    **Authentication**: Bearer Token  

    The request requires authentication via a bearer token, which must be
    included in the request headers.


    - **Key**: `token`  
      - Represents the authentication token required for validating the request.

    - **Value**: `BearerToken`  
      - This is a placeholder for the actual bearer token that should be provided when the request is made.

    - **Type**: string  
      - Indicates that the value of the token must be a string.

    **URL**:  

    `http://localhost:3000/api/university/university/get/?universityId=universityId&sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId`  

    This is the endpoint URL where the request is sent. It includes query
    parameters that are necessary to identify the specific university and
    session.


    - **Query Parameters**:
      - **universityId**:  
        - This parameter is used to specify the unique identifier of the university that you want to retrieve information about.
      
      - **sessionId**:  
        - This parameter is used to indicate the specific session for which the information is relevant. This could refer to a term, semester, or academic year.

      - **accountId**:  
        - This parameter represents the identifier for the account making the request, enabling any account-specific data retrieval or access control.

    **Headers**:  

    The request may include headers, but in this case, the provided header
    parameters are empty and the header is disabled.


    - **Key**:  
      - Currently, there are no headers specified. However, additional headers can be defined if necessary by adding key-value pairs.

    - **Value**:  
      - As there are no headers in use, this remains empty.

    - **Type**: default  
      - Indicates the header type, though in this instance no headers are applied.

    **Body**:  

    The body of the request is not used in this GET request.


    - **Mode**: raw  
      - Specifies that the request body is in raw format, although no body content is included.

    - **Raw**:  
      - The body is empty (`""`), which is typical for GET requests as they do not require a message body to send data.
